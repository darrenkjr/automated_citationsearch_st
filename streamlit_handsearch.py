We are tracking the use of this tool as a means to understand whether handsearching should form best practice in evidence retrieval. We are developing software to extract data from PRISMA diagrams, and hope to release this publically soon. Citing us would mean that we can systematically study how citation based methods perform in combination with traditional search strategies.')
