There have been many studies on the use of HBB during labor with conflicting results, involving both primiparous and multiparous women. The aim of this trial was to study the efficacy of HBB for shortening the first stage of labor in primiparous women. Methods The study was a randomized, double blind, controlled trial. Ninety-seven primigravid term pregnant women in spontaneous labor received either hyoscine butylbromide or a placebo intramuscularly once the women entered the active phase of labor. The primary outcome measured was the duration of the first stage of labor. Secondary outcomes were the duration of the second and third stages of labor, blood loss at delivery, rate of cesarean section, and Apgar scores for the neonates. Results A total of 97 women yielded data for analysis. Of these, 45 women received the placebo and 52 received HBB. The mean duration of the first stage in the control group was 215 minutes, compared with 165 minutes in the study group, representing a decrease of 23.3% (P = 0.001). There were no significant changes in the duration of the second (P = 0.063) or third (P = 0.0418) stages of labor, and no significant differences in blood loss or Apgar scores. There was a slightly higher (but statistically insignificant) rate of instrumental delivery in the control group, but no difference in the Cesarean section rate. There was a 60% reduction in opioid analgesic use in the HBB group. Conclusion HBB is effective in significantly reducing the duration of the first stage of labor, and is not associated with any apparent adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes.",Therapeutics and clinical risk management,2011.0,34.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '35919149', 'name': 'N.

In this paper, we extend question-answering techniques, first studied in the information retrieval literature, to the web and experimentally evaluate their performance.First we introduce Mulder, which we believe to be the first general-purpose, fully-automated question-answering system available on the web. Second, we describe Mulder's architecture, which relies on multiple search-engine queries, natural-language parsing, and a novel voting procedure to yield reliable answers coupled with high recall. Finally, we compare Mulder's performance to that of Google and AskJeeves on questions drawn from the TREC-8 question answering track. We find that Mulder's recall is more than a factor of three higher than that of AskJeeves. In addition, we find that Google requires 6.6 times as much user effort to achieve the same level of recall as Mulder.",TOIS,2001.0,355.0,['Computer Science'],"[{'authorId': '1983124', 'name': 'Cody C.

Clustering large sets of text documents is important for a variety of information needs and applications such as collection management and navigation, summary and analysis. The few comparisons of clustering results from different similarity approaches have focused on small literature sets and have given conflicting results. Our study was designed to seek a robust answer to the question of which similarity approach would generate the most coherent clusters of a biomedical literature set of over two million documents. Methodology We used a corpus of 2.15 million recent (2004-2008) records from MEDLINE, and generated nine different document-document similarity matrices from information extracted from their bibliographic records, including titles, abstracts and subject headings. The nine approaches were comprised of five different analytical techniques with two data sources. The five analytical techniques are cosine similarity using term frequency-inverse document frequency vectors (tf-idf cosine), latent semantic analysis (LSA), topic modeling, and two Poisson-based language models – BM25 and PMRA (PubMed Related Articles). The two data sources were a) MeSH subject headings, and b) words from titles and abstracts. Each similarity matrix was filtered to keep the top-n highest similarities per document and then clustered using a combination of graph layout and average-link clustering. Cluster results from the nine similarity approaches were compared using (1) within-cluster textual coherence based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence, and (2) two concentration measures based on grant-to-article linkages indexed in MEDLINE. Conclusions PubMed's own related article approach (PMRA) generated the most coherent and most concentrated cluster solution of the nine text-based similarity approaches tested, followed closely by the BM25 approach using titles and abstracts. Approaches using only MeSH subject headings were not competitive with those based on titles and abstracts.",PloS one,2011.0,222.0,"['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '1773125', 'name': 'K.

8,080fe7987e1bbc97372177d57267ed56fb113051,"Meta-Analyst: software for meta-analysis of binary, continuous and diagnostic data","Meta-analysis is increasingly used as a key source of evidence synthesis to inform clinical practice. The theory and statistical foundations of meta-analysis continually evolve, providing solutions to many new and challenging problems. In practice, most meta-analyses are performed in general statistical packages or dedicated meta-analysis programs. Herein, we introduce Meta-Analyst, a novel, powerful, intuitive, and free meta-analysis program for the meta-analysis of a variety of problems. Meta-Analyst is implemented in C# atop of the Microsoft .NET framework, and features a graphical user interface. The software performs several meta-analysis and meta-regression models for binary and continuous outcomes, as well as analyses for diagnostic and prognostic test studies in the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. Moreover, Meta-Analyst includes a flexible tool to edit and customize generated meta-analysis graphs (e.g., forest plots) and provides output in many formats (images, Adobe PDF, Microsoft Word-ready RTF). The software architecture employed allows for rapid changes to be made to either the Graphical User Interface (GUI) or to the analytic modules. We verified the numerical precision of Meta-Analyst by comparing its output with that from standard meta-analysis routines in Stata over a large database of 11,803 meta-analyses of binary outcome data, and 6,881 meta-analyses of continuous outcome data from the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews. Results from analyses of diagnostic and prognostic test studies have been verified in a limited number of meta-analyses versus MetaDisc and MetaTest. Bayesian statistical analyses use the OpenBUGS calculation engine (and are thus as accurate as the standalone OpenBUGS software).

We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. Design: Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews . Main outcome measure: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision. Results: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias. Conclusions: A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution. Key messages Systematic reviews of randomised trials are the best strategy for appraising evidence; however, the findings of some meta-analyses were later contradicted by large trials Funnel plots, plots of the trials9 effect estimates against sample size, are skewed and asymmetrical in the presence of publication bias and other biases Funnel plot asymmetry, measured by regression analysis, predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared with single large trials Funnel plot asymmetry was found in 38% of meta-analyses published in leading general medicine journals and in 13% of reviews from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Critical examination of systematic reviews for publication and related biases should be considered a routine procedure",BMJ,1997.0,,,[]
11,0f895a272d19158cb846a75db1c15a693d99a200,Evaluation of the usefulness of Internet searches to identify unpublished clinical trials for systematic reviews.,"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
To avoid selection and publication bias, systematic reviewers should employ a broad range of search techniques and make efforts to locate unpublished studies. We tried to establish whether searches on the World Wide Web (WWW) are useful to identify additional unpublished and ongoing clinical trials.


RESEARCH DESIGN
Search strategies seven Cochrane systematic reviews were retrospectively adapted for the WWW in an attempt to find additional randomized controlled trials.


METHODS AND PROCEDURES
A search strategy with the general pattern 'study methodology NEAR intervention NEAR condition' for the Internet search engine AltaVista was evaluated by measuring search time, recall of Internet searches for published studies; precision (proportion of webpages containing hints to relevant published and unpublished randomized clinical trials); number of additional unpublished or ongoing studies found on the Internet.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS
We reviewed 429 webpages in 21 hours and found hints to 14 unpublished, ongoing or recently finished trials, at least 9 were considered relevant for 4 systematic reviews. The recall of Internet searches to find references to published studies ranged between 0% and 43.6%, the precision for hints to published or unpublished studies range between 0% and 20.2%.


CONCLUSIONS
Information on unpublished and particularly ongoing trials can be found on the Internet. A potential problem is the appraisal of non-peer reviewed electronic publications with questionable quality. More powerful search tools are needed. An 'Open Trial Initiative' is proposed to define a syntax for publishing trials on the web and to ensure interoperability of trial registers, so that special search engines can harvest information on ongoing and complete clinical trials.",Medical informatics and the Internet in medicine,2001.0,47.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '1754570', 'name': 'G.

The specific motivations underlying this research include the following propositions: Reasoning from experimental evidence contained in the clinical literature is central to the decisions physicians make in patient care. A computational model, based upon a declarative representation for published reports of clinical studies, can drive a computer program that selectively tailors knowledge of the clinical literature as it is applied to a particular case. The development of such a computational model is an important first step toward filling a void in computer-based decision support systems. Furthermore, the model may help us better understand the general principles of reasoning from experimental evidence both in medicine and other domains. Roundsman is a developmental computer system which draws upon structured representations of the clinical literature in order to critique plans for the management of primary breast cancer. Roundsman is able to produce patient-specific analyses of breast cancer management options based on the 24 clinical studies currently encoded in its knowledge base.

14,14bd75c23455a313944ad6885d4b20764d1bf25a,Development of a highly sensitive search strategy for the retrieval of reports of controlled trials using PubMed.,"OBJECTIVE
To develop, through revision of the Cochrane Collaboration search strategy for OVID-MEDLINE, a highly sensitive search strategy to retrieve reports of controlled trials using PubMed.


METHODS
The original highly sensitive Cochrane strategy was revised to take into account additional Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and other terminology as well as the current unique features of PubMed. We compared the retrieval of the revised strategy with that of the original Cochrane strategy before and after translation of the strategies into PubMed format. Finally, we used a gold standard database of reports of controlled trials identified by electronic and hand search of selected journals to test the revised strategy in PubMed format.


RESULTS
The revised strategy included a search statement modified for increased precision, and added 'Cross-over Studies' as a MeSH term and the term 'latin square' as a text word. Compared to the original Cochrane strategy, the revised strategy identified 53 additional reports of controlled trials accessing MEDLINE through OVID. When the revised strategy and original Cochrane strategy were translated into PubMed format, the revised strategy retrieved 90 reports of controlled trials not identified by the original strategy. Finally, the revised strategy in PubMed format retrieved all of the reports of controlled trials in the gold standard database. Ninety-eight per cent of the gold standard reports of controlled trials were retrieved by Phase 1 of the optimal PubMed search strategy.


CONCLUSIONS
Failure to identify all relevant trials for systematic review could result in bias. We developed a highly sensitive search strategy for the retrieval of reports of controlled trials for use with PubMed that retrieves more relevant citations (greater sensitivity) and fewer non-relevant citations (greater precision) than the original Cochrane search strategy.",International journal of epidemiology,2002.0,727.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '34867787', 'name': 'K.

Significant new evidence was already available for 7% of the reviews at the time of publication and became available for 23% within 2 years. Implication Clinically important evidence that alters conclusions about the effectiveness and harms of treatments can accumulate rapidly. The Editors Systematic reviews have become increasingly common in recent years (1) and are recommended by many as the best sources of evidence to guide both clinical decisions (2) and health care policy (3). For systematic reviews to fulfill these roles, their findings must remain relatively stable for at least several years or effective mechanisms must exist for alerting end users to important changes in evidence. Yet, surprisingly little research has assessed the extent to which systematic reviews become out of date or the rate at which this occurs (47). Some organizations, such as the Cochrane Collaboration, recommend updating systematic reviews every 2 years, but few empirical data guide this or other recommendations about updating. We sought to determine how quickly systematic reviews meet explicitly defined criteria for changes in evidence of sufficient importance to warrant updating. We also sought to identify predictors of survival time, the time to such important changes in evidence. Survival time might vary depending on many factors, including the type of question posed by the original review (for example, therapeutic or diagnostic), the types of studies included (for example, randomized trials or observational studies), and whether the systematic review provided quantitative synthesis. To limit such variation, we focused on systematic reviews of randomized, controlled trials that evaluated therapeutic benefit or harm by providing quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) for at least 1 outcome. Methods Study Design and Sample We used a quasi-random process (alphabetical sort order by author) to select 100 systematic reviews that were indexed in ACP Journal Club with an accompanying commentary between January 1995 and December 2005 (with a search date no later than 31 December 2004 to ensure at least 1 full year for new evidence to appear). We chose this sampling frame because ACP Journal Club selects systematic reviews that meet explicit quality standards and are deemed directly relevant to clinical practice (8). We regarded the sample size of 100 as sufficiently large to achieve suitably narrow confidence intervals and to permit evaluation of up to 5 potential predictors of survival. Eligibility Criteria Eligible reviews evaluated the benefit or harm of a specific drug, class of drug, device, or procedure (invasive procedure or surgery) and included randomized or quasi-randomized, controlled trials. We excluded evaluations of alternative and complementary medicines because the stability of reviews of such therapies might differ substantially from reviews of conventional therapies. We required that reviews provide a point estimate and 95% confidence interval for at least 1 outcome in the form of a relative risk, odds ratio, or absolute risk difference for binary outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes. We excluded meta-analyses of individual-patient data, meta-regressions, and indirect meta-analyses because of the difficulty of determining whether new data would alter previous quantitative results. Two team members independently assessed eligibility, with disagreements resolved by consensus involving a third reviewer. When more than 1 review on the same topic was identified, only the earliest was included. Searching For each review, searches for new trials included identifying new systematic reviews on the same topic, submitting relevant content terms to the Clinical Queries function in Ovid, applying the Related Articles function in PubMed to the 3 largest and the 3 most recent trials in the original review (up to 6 trials in total), and using Scopus (www.scopus.com/scopus/home.url) to identify new randomized trials that cited the original review. When these search strategies yielded no eligible new trials, we conducted more comprehensive electronic searches and reviewed relevant chapters in such sources as Clinical Evidence and UpToDate to ensure that we had not missed new trials. Team members who had backgrounds in both medicine and clinical research screened citations retrieved by the preceding methods to identify trials that would have met the inclusion criteria in the original review. Retrieved articles were screened in chronological order to ascertain quantitative or qualitative signals for the need for updating. The review protocol stopped when any criteria for updating were met. Each systematic review was discussed in detail, with the final statussignal for updating was or was not detectedadjudicated by consensus (Figure 1). Figure 1. Overall process for determining updating status. ACP Journal Club Signals for the Need to Update Systematic Reviews In designing criteria for comparing new findings with those in a previous review, we adapted methods used by other investigators to address similar problems with comparing 2 sets of results relating to the same question (913), such as randomized and nonrandomized studies of the same intervention. These investigators identified conflicting findings among different publications using a combination of quantitative thresholds for differences in effect magnitude and qualitative judgments about the language used to describe the results. We have similarly conceptualized quantitative and qualitative signals of potential changes in evidence that are sufficiently important to warrant updating previous systematic reviews. Quantitative Signals Quantitative signals consisted of a change in statistical significance or relative change in effect magnitude of at least 50%. We restricted these changes to those involving 1 of the primary outcomes of the original review or any mortality outcome. We also ignored trivial changes in statistical significancewhen the original and updated meta-analytic results both had P values between 0.04 and 0.06so that quantitative signals of changes in evidence would represent robust indicators of the need to update previous reviews. Quantitative signals were detected by combining data from eligible new trials with the previous results using a fixed-effects approach. Use of fixed-effect models allowed pooling of the new trials with the previous meta-analytic result, as opposed to having to obtain original data from all of the included trials in each of 100 systematic reviews. Although random-effects models are usually preferred to avoid spurious precision in the face of heterogeneity, our goal was to detect potential changes in evidence that would warrant a formal update, not produce exact estimates of the updated results. Qualitative Signals Qualitative signals included new information about harm sufficient to affect clinical decision making, important caveats to the original results, emergence of a superior alternate therapy, and important changes in certainty or direction of effect. Qualitative signals were detected by using explicit criteria for comparing the language in the original review with descriptions of findings in new systematic reviews that addressed the same topic, pivotal trials, clinical practice guidelines, or recent editions of major textbooks (for example, UpToDate). Pivotal trials were defined as trials that had a sample size at least 3 times larger than that of the previous largest trial or were published in 1 of the 5 highest-impact general medical journals (The New England Journal of Medicine, Lancet, Journal of the American Medical Association, Annals of Internal Medicine, and the British Medical Journal). We defined 2 levels of importance for qualitative signals: potentially invalidating changes in evidence, which would make one no longer want clinicians or policymakers to base decisions on the original findings (such as a pivotal trial that characterized treatment effectiveness in terms opposite of those in the original systematic review), and major changes in evidence, which would affect clinical decision making in important ways without invalidating the previous results (such as the identification of patient populations for whom treatment is more or less beneficial). Major changes also included differing characterizations of effectiveness that were less extreme than those for potentially invalidating signals but that would still affect clinical decision making (for example, a change from possibly beneficial to definitely beneficial). Of importance, such characterizations as possibly effective, probably effective, and promising, were all categorized as possibly effective. Thus, qualitative signals for changes in evidence captured substantive differences in the characterization of treatment effects, not merely semantic differences. Full definitions for each of the specific signals can be found at www.ohri.ca/UpdatingSystRevs. Data Collection For each review, we characterized the clinical content area, eligibility criteria for included trials, definitions of reported outcomes, number of included trials and participants, meta-analytic result for each outcome, identification of statistical heterogeneity, and excerpted quotations of the authors' characterizations of the main results. We also abstracted whether a given outcome was explicitly identified as 1 of the primary or main outcomes. We discounted identification of more than 3 such outcomes as inconsistent with the co",Annals of Internal Medicine,2007.0,492.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '1764335', 'name': 'K.

We envision IHI as ACMs premier community forum concerned with the application of computer and information science principles as well as information and communication technology to problems in healthcare, public health, the delivery of healthcare services and consumer health informatics aspects, and finally, the related social and ethical issues on the use of computing technology in the health informatics domain. We designed IHI to run as an annual showcase for exciting and innovative research on techniques and technologies developed in universities, hospitals, research labs, and companies all over the world. And here we are, in the very first meeting with a very strong program comprising oral and poster presentations, demos, a very distinguished keynote presentation, and a panel. I am humbled to have a chance to chair such a strong first meeting. 
 
When I was offered the General Chair position for this conference, I accepted with great anxiety, and the anxiety turned to horror when I realized what it really means to organize the very first meeting of a new conference series. One of my first challenges was to draft a budget for the conference. There were many questions that needed to be answered, and we did not have any basis for answering many of them, just our guesses and wish list. How many papers would we receive and include in the conference? How many people would attend our conference? How long the conference should be? Where it should be held? and so on. I am delighted to see that the communitys interest exceeded our estimates and we have received more than 240 submissions, from more than 30 countries, which enabled us to put together an excellent program. 
 
Putting together a conference is a team effort. I am extremely honored to work with such a group of talented and devoted individuals. You will find the complete list of organizers in the proceedings; here I will only name a few of them. I will start with the driving force behind this conference, our honorary general chair, Gang Luo, without his energy, commitment and persistence, we may not have had the IHI conference this year. I must also thank the program committee co-chairs Henrique Andrade and Neil R. Smalheiser for their invaluable contributions not only during the paper review process, but also for their help and comments regarding every aspect of the conference, including Henriques help to create the first version of our conference web site. Later on, Mehmet Deveci and Daby M. Sow took over that task, constantly improving the content with additional information and kept it up to date. Bugra Gedik diligently handled the registrations, while Alper Yilmaz made sure that we were always on track with our budget and assisted with all of the final logistics transactions. Organizing a conference in a different location from where I am based meant that I needed a devoted local arrangement chair, and I was lucky to know Baris E. Suzek he was on top of every single detail regarding the local arrangements. Xue-Wen Chen, Albert M. Lai, and Deepak Turaga have done tremendous job in publicizing our conference, at times with many one-to-one emails. Our proceedings chair Tiffany Veinot not only worked with Sheridan for proceedings, but also helped putting together the program booklet. Special thanks go to Donna Cappo and April Mosqus from ACM for their patience and help in answering our endless questions, to Adrienne Griscti for initiating the ACM-Sheridan Proceedings Service, assisted by Lisa Tolles, for taking care of processing the papers in a timely manner. Jinbo Bi was our contact person for sponsorship and she helped us secure generous support from IBM, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Indiana University, Google Research, Hidola, and Siemens. We are of course also grateful for our sponsors for their financial support. Last but not least, I would like to thank the authors for providing the content of the program and the program committee and external reviewers for their hard work in carefully reviewing all of the submissions and providing feedback to the authors. 
 
On behalf of the conference organizing committee, we hope you find many topics of interest in our program, and hope that you enjoy your stay in the Washington, DC metropolitan area.

However, most of this information is available only in free text - e.g., in journal publications - which is labour intensive to process for systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and other evidence synthesis studies. This paper presents an automatic information extraction system, called ExaCT, that assists users with locating and extracting key trial characteristics (e.g., eligibility criteria, sample size, drug dosage, primary outcomes) from full-text journal articles reporting on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). ExaCT consists of two parts: an information extraction (IE) engine that searches the article for text fragments that best describe the trial characteristics, and a web browser-based user interface that allows human reviewers to assess and modify the suggested selections. The IE engine uses a statistical text classifier to locate those sentences that have the highest probability of describing a trial characteristic. Then, the IE engine's second stage applies simple rules to these sentences to extract text fragments containing the target answer. The same approach is used for all 21 trial characteristics selected for this study. We evaluated ExaCT using 50 previously unseen articles describing RCTs. The text classifier (first stage) was able to recover 88% of relevant sentences among its top five candidates (top5 recall) with the topmost candidate being relevant in 80% of cases (top1 precision). Precision and recall of the extraction rules (second stage) were 93% and 91%, respectively. Together, the two stages of the extraction engine were able to provide (partially) correct solutions in 992 out of 1050 test tasks (94%), with a majority of these (696) representing fully correct and complete answers. Our experiments confirmed the applicability and efficacy of ExaCT. Furthermore, they demonstrated that combining a statistical method with 'weak' extraction rules can identify a variety of study characteristics. The system is flexible and can be extended to handle other characteristics and document types (e.g., study protocols).",BMC Medical Informatics Decis.

DALYs use a standard expected-life lost based on model life-table West Level 26. Second, the value of time lived at different ages is captured in DALYs using an exponential function which reflects the dependence of the young and the elderly on adults. Third, the time lived with a disability is made comparable with the time lost due to premature mortality by defining six classes of disability severity. Assigned to each class is a severity weight between 0 and 1. Finally, a three percent discount rate is used in the calculation of DALYs.

Having an up-to-date and comprehensive review is therefore important. Our main objective was to determine the recency of systematic reviews at the time of their publication, as measured by the time from last search date to publication. We also wanted to study the time from search date to acceptance, and from acceptance to publication, and measure the proportion of systematic reviews with recorded information on search dates and information sources in the abstract and full text of the review. Methods: A descriptive analysis of published systematic reviews indexed in Medline in 2009, 2010 and 2011 by three reviewers, independently extracting data. Results: Of the 300 systematic reviews included, 271 (90%) provided the date of search in the full-text article, but only 141 (47%) stated this in the abstract. The median (standard error; minimum to maximum) survival time from last search to acceptance was 5.1 (0.58; 0 to 43.8) months (95% confidence interval = 3.9 to 6.2) and from last search to first publication time was 8.0 (0.35; 0 to 46.7) months (95% confidence interval = 7.3 to 8.7), respectively. Of the 300 reviews, 295 (98%) stated which databases had been searched, but only 181 (60%) stated the databases in the abstract. Most researchers searched three (35%) or four (21%) databases. The top-three most used databases were MEDLINE (79%), Cochrane library (76%), and EMBASE (64%). Conclusions: Being able to identify comprehensive, up-to-date reviews is important to clinicians, guideline groups, and those designing clinical trials. This study demonstrates that some reviews have a considerable delay between search and publication, but only 47% of systematic review abstracts stated the last search date and 60% stated the databases that had been searched.

To date, the scientific process for generating, interpreting, and applying knowledge has received less informatics attention than operational processes for conducting clinical studies. The activities of these scientific processes - the science of clinical research - are centered on the study protocol, which is the abstract representation of the scientific design of a clinical study. The Ontology of Clinical Research (OCRe) is an OWL 2 model of the entities and relationships of study design protocols for the purpose of computationally supporting the design and analysis of human studies. OCRe's modeling is independent of any specific study design or clinical domain. It includes a study design typology and a specialized module called ERGO Annotation for capturing the meaning of eligibility criteria. In this paper, we describe the key informatics use cases of each phase of a study's scientific lifecycle, present OCRe and the principles behind its modeling, and describe applications of OCRe and associated technologies to a range of clinical research use cases.

This survey presents a unified view of a large number of recent approaches to AQE that leverage various data sources and employ very different principles and techniques. The following questions are addressed. Why is query expansion so important to improve search effectiveness? What are the main steps involved in the design and implementation of an AQE component? What approaches to AQE are available and how do they compare?

The breadth of evidence mapping helps to identify evidence gaps, and may guide future research efforts. The Global Evidence Mapping (GEM) Initiative was established in 2007 to create evidence maps providing an overview of existing research in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Spinal Cord Injury (SCI). The GEM evidence mapping method involved three core tasks: 1. Setting the boundaries and context of the map: Definitions for the fields of TBI and SCI were clarified, the prehospital, acute inhospital and rehabilitation phases of care were delineated and relevant stakeholders (patients, carers, clinicians, researchers and policymakers) who could contribute to the mapping were identified. Researchable clinical questions were developed through consultation with key stakeholders and a broad literature search. 2. Searching for and selection of relevant studies: Evidence search and selection involved development of specific search strategies, development of inclusion and exclusion criteria, searching of relevant databases and independent screening and selection by two researchers. 3. Reporting on yield and study characteristics: Data extraction was performed at two levels - 'interventions and study design' and 'detailed study characteristics'. The evidence map and commentary reflected the depth of data extraction. One hundred and twenty-nine researchable clinical questions in TBI and SCI were identified. These questions were then prioritised into high (n = 60) and low (n = 69) importance by the stakeholders involved in question development. Since 2007, 58 263 abstracts have been screened, 3 731 full text articles have been reviewed and 1 644 relevant neurotrauma publications have been mapped, covering fifty-three high priority questions. GEM Initiative evidence maps have a broad range of potential end-users including funding agencies, researchers and clinicians. Evidence mapping is at least as resource-intensive as systematic reviewing. The GEM Initiative has made advancements in evidence mapping, most notably in the area of question development and prioritisation. Evidence mapping complements other review methods for describing existing research, informing future research efforts, and addressing evidence gaps.",BMC medical research methodology,2011.0,176.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '4893810', 'name': 'P.

Now the British government has the chance to match Medline by funding universal free access to what might be described as “a Medline of synthesised, reliable, and up to date evidence.” This could be even more useful to clinicians and patients and has the potential to change health care across the world.

Medline is an electronic index of nearly 4500 journals from over 70 countries compiled by Washington's National Library of Medicine. It has been available online since 1971. Later, Hilary Clinton, then America's first lady, announced worldwide free access to Medline through the internet (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/). Since then the number of people using it has increased exponentially, and many of them are patients. There is no better free starting point for finding high quality medical information.

But a search of Medline may be frustrating. Although Medline often includes abstracts and free access to the full text of some articles (including those in the BMJ ), clinicians and patients may be overwhelmed by an avalanche of references and abstracts. They only rarely have the time and resources to sift through the output of a search, let alone obtain the full texts of all the articles that may answer their questions. Clinicians and patients need ready access to syntheses of valid, up to date information relevant to their questions.

Springing from the success of IHI'10, IHI'12 continues to be the pivotal forum for presenting research results and sharing experience on the leading-edge issues of computing-oriented health informatics. 
 
This year's symposium attracted over 300 submissions by around 1,000 authors from 37 countries in all continents (except Antarctica), 25% more than that of IHI'10. The percentage of international PC members and conference officers at IHI'12 is 40%, more than doubling that of IHI'10. Over 200 people have served as PC members and conference officers for IHI'12. IHT'12 covers more than 100 topics, which are twice those of IHI'10. This year is the first time that IHI introduces paper tracks, namely analytics, systems, and human factors. The program is also enriched with doctoral consortium, extended abstract, and free tutorial. As a result, the review load of IHI'12 has been controlled under eight reviews per PC member, which is in turn more reasonable and better qualityassured than IHI'10. We hope this year's symposium has successfully set trends and standards for future IHI conferences, as one of the premier international health informatics forums attracting researchers and practitioners from diverse areas in both computer science and medicine. We believe this is important for the development of health informatics, as new progresses can readily benefit from sharing new knowledge and experience and from forging new collaborations across multiple research areas and multiple geographic areas.",IHI 2012,2012.0,21.0,['Computer Science'],"[{'authorId': '144050849', 'name': 'Gang Luo'}, {'authorId': '35761977', 'name': 'Jiming Liu'}, {'authorId': '2109467612', 'name': 'Chris Yang'}]"

However, it is unclear whether this interval is always appropriate. Whereas excessive updating wastes time and resources, insufficient updating allows out-of-date or incomplete evidence to guide clinical decision-making. We set out to determine, for Cochrane pregnancy and childbirth reviews, the frequency of updates, factors associated with updating, and whether updating frequency was appropriate. Methodology/Principal Findings Cochrane pregnancy and childbirth reviews published in Issue 3, 2007 of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were retrieved, and data were collected from their original and updated versions. Quantitative changes were determined for one of the primary outcomes (mortality, or the outcome of greatest clinical significance). Potential factors associated with time to update were assessed using the Cox proportional hazard model. Among the 101 reviews in our final sample, the median time before the first update was 3.3 years (95% CI 2.7–3.8). Only 32.7% had been updated within the recommended interval of 2 years. In 75.3% (76/101), a median of 3 new trials with a median of 576 additional participants were included in the updated versions. There were quantitative changes in 71% of the reviews that included new trials (54/76): the median change in effect size was 18.2%, and the median change in 95% CI width was 30.8%. Statistical significance changed in 18.5% (10/54) of these reviews, but conclusions were revised in only 3.7% (2/54). A shorter time to update was associated with the same original review team at updating. Conclusions/Significance Most reviews were updated less frequently than recommended by Cochrane policy, but few updates had revised conclusions. Prescribed time to update should be reconsidered to support improved decision-making while making efficient use of limited resources.",PloS one,2010.0,20.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '4903764', 'name': 'Wanlop Jaidee'}, {'authorId': '1825473', 'name': 'D.

Because many articles are indexed in more than one of these databases, it is desirable to deduplicate the retrieved article records. This is not a trivial problem because data fields contain a lot of missing and erroneous entries, and because certain types of information are recorded differently (and inconsistently) in the different databases. The present report describes our rule-based method for deduplicating article records across databases and includes an open-source script module that can be deployed freely. Metta was designed to satisfy the particular needs of people who are writing systematic reviews in evidence-based medicine. These users want the highest possible recall in retrieval, so it is important to err on the side of not deduplicating any records that refer to distinct articles, and it is important to perform deduplication online in real time. Our deduplication module is designed with these constraints in mind. Articles that share the same publication year are compared sequentially on parameters including PubMed ID number, digital object identifier, journal name, article title and author list, using text approximation techniques. In a review of Metta searches carried out by public users, we found that the deduplication module was more effective at identifying duplicates than EndNote without making any erroneous assignments.",Database J.

Sickle cell disease is characterized by a state of nitric oxide resistance and limited bioavailability of l-arginine, the substrate for nitric oxide synthesis. We hypothesized that increased arginase activity and dysregulated arginine metabolism contribute to endothelial dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and patient outcomes.


OBJECTIVE
To explore the role of arginase in sickle cell disease pathogenesis, pulmonary hypertension, and mortality.


DESIGN
Plasma amino acid levels, plasma and erythrocyte arginase activities, and pulmonary hypertension status as measured by Doppler echocardiogram were prospectively obtained in outpatients with sickle cell disease. Patients were followed up for survival up to 49 months.


SETTING
Urban tertiary care center and community clinics in the United States between February 2001 and March 2005.


PARTICIPANTS
Two hundred twenty-eight patients with sickle cell disease, aged 18 to 74 years, and 36 control participants.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Plasma amino acid levels, plasma and erythrocyte arginase activities, diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, and mortality.


RESULTS
Plasma arginase activity was significantly elevated in patients with sickle cell disease, with highest activity found in patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension. Arginase activity correlated with the arginine-ornithine ratio, and lower ratios were associated with greater severity of pulmonary hypertension and with mortality in this population (risk ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-5.2; P = .006). Global arginine bioavailability, characterized by the ratio of arginine to ornithine plus citrulline, was also strongly associated with mortality (risk ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.5-8.3; P<.001). Increased plasma arginase activity was correlated with increased intravascular hemolytic rate and, to a lesser extent, with markers of inflammation and soluble adhesion molecule levels.


CONCLUSIONS
These data support a novel mechanism of disease in which hemolysis contributes to reduced nitric oxide bioavailability and endothelial dysfunction via release of erythrocyte arginase, which limits arginine bioavailability, and release of erythrocyte hemoglobin, which scavenges nitric oxide. The ratios of arginine to ornithine and arginine to ornithine plus citrulline are independently associated with pulmonary hypertension and increased mortality in patients with sickle cell disease.",JAMA,2005.0,499.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '1703228', 'name': 'C.

Citation screening is a time-consuming and critical step in systematic reviews. Typically, reviewers must evaluate thousands of citations to identify articles eligible for a given review. We explore the application of machine learning techniques to semi-automate citation screening, thereby reducing the reviewers' workload. We present a novel online classification strategy for citation screening to automatically discriminate relevant from irrelevant citations. We use an ensemble of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) built over different feature-spaces (e.g., abstract and title text), and trained interactively by the reviewer(s). Semi-automating the citation screening process is difficult because any such strategy must identify all citations eligible for the systematic review. This requirement is made harder still due to class imbalance; there are far fewer relevant than irrelevant citations for any given systematic review. To address these challenges we employ a custom active-learning strategy developed specifically for imbalanced datasets. Further, we introduce a novel undersampling technique. We provide experimental results over three real-world systematic review datasets, and demonstrate that our algorithm is able to reduce the number of citations that must be screened manually by nearly half in two of these, and by around 40% in the third, without excluding any of the citations eligible for the systematic review. We have developed a semi-automated citation screening algorithm for systematic reviews that has the potential to substantially reduce the number of citations reviewers have to manually screen, without compromising the quality and comprehensiveness of the review.",BMC Bioinformatics,2010.0,262.0,"['Medicine', 'Computer Science']","[{'authorId': '1912476', 'name': 'Byron C.

More recently, Google Scholar has gained popularity as another freely accessible bibliographic database. Objective To compare the performance of searches in PubMed and Google Scholar. Methods We surveyed nephrologists (kidney specialists) and provided each with a unique clinical question derived from 100 renal therapy systematic reviews. Each physician provided the search terms they would type into a bibliographic database to locate evidence to answer the clinical question. We executed each of these searches in PubMed and Google Scholar and compared results for the first 40 records retrieved (equivalent to 2 default search pages in PubMed). We evaluated the recall (proportion of relevant articles found) and precision (ratio of relevant to nonrelevant articles) of the searches performed in PubMed and Google Scholar. Primary studies included in the systematic reviews served as the reference standard for relevant articles. We further documented whether relevant articles were available as free full-texts. Results Compared with PubMed, the average search in Google Scholar retrieved twice as many relevant articles (PubMed: 11%; Google Scholar: 22%; P<.001).

This paper reports on the development of a tool by the Arizona Health Sciences Library (AHSL) for searching clinical evidence that can be customized for different user groups.


BRIEF DESCRIPTION
The AHSL provides services to the University of Arizona's (UA's) health sciences programs and to the University Medical Center. Librarians at AHSL collaborated with UA College of Medicine faculty to create an innovative search engine, Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) Search, that provides users with a simple search interface to EBM resources and presents results organized according to an evidence pyramid. EBM Search was developed with a web-based configuration component that allows the tool to be customized for different specialties.


OUTCOMES/CONCLUSION
Informal and anecdotal feedback from physicians indicates that EBM Search is a useful tool with potential in teaching evidence-based decision making. While formal evaluation is still being planned, a tool such as EBM Search, which can be configured for specific user populations, may help lower barriers to information resources in an academic health sciences center.",Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA,2008.0,16.0,"['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '2191753', 'name': 'Paul J.

Meta-DiSc a) allows exploration of heterogeneity, with a variety of statistics including chi-square, I-squared and Spearman correlation tests, b) implements meta-regression techniques to explore the relationships between study characteristics and accuracy estimates, c) performs statistical pooling of sensitivities, specificities, likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratios using fixed and random effects models, both overall and in subgroups and d) produces high quality figures, including forest plots and summary receiver operating characteristic curves that can be exported for use in manuscripts for publication. All computational algorithms have been validated through comparison with different statistical tools and published meta-analyses. Meta-DiSc has a Graphical User Interface with roll-down menus, dialog boxes, and online help facilities. Meta-DiSc is a comprehensive and dedicated test accuracy meta-analysis software.

Clinicians and patients are increasingly accessing information through Internet searches. This study aimed to examine clinicians' current search behavior when using the Turning Research Into Practice (TRIP) database to examine search engine use and the ways it might be improved.


METHODS
A Web log analysis was undertaken of the TRIP database-a meta-search engine covering 150 health resources including MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, and a variety of guidelines. The connectors for terms used in searches were studied, and observations were made of 9 users' search behavior when working with the TRIP database.


RESULTS
Of 620,735 searches, most used a single term, and 12% (n = 75,947) used a Boolean operator: 11% (n = 69,006) used ""AND"" and 0.8% (n = 4,941) used ""OR."" Of the elements of a well-structured clinical question (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome), the population was most commonly used, while fewer searches included the intervention. Comparator and outcome were rarely used. Participants in the observational study were interested in learning how to formulate better searches.

The growing interest in qualitative research within the evidence based practice framework highlights the need for accurate search strategies to enhance the retrieval of qualitative studies. To date, little work has been done on developing optimal search filters for retrieving qualitative studies. The current study extends our earlier work, on developing optimal search strategies, to include qualitative studies.


OBJECTIVE
To develop optimal search strategies for detecting clinically relevant qualitative studies in MEDLINE in the publishing year 2000.


DESIGN
Comparison of the retrieval performance of methodologic search strategies in MEDLINE with a manual review (""gold standard"") of each article for each issue of 161 core health care journals for the year 2000.


METHODS
6 experienced research assistants who had been trained and intensively calibrated reviewed all issues of 161 journals for the publishing year 2000. Each article was systematically classified for ""format"" (whether it was an original study, review article, general article, or case report), ""interest"" (whether or not it was of interest to the health care of humans), and ""purpose"" (whether it pertained to therapy, diagnosis, prognosis, causation, economics, costs, or clinical prediction; was of a qualitative nature; or was about something else). Search strategies were developed for all purpose categories, including qualitative studies.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
The sensitivity (recall), specificity, precision, and accuracy of single and combinations of search terms.


RESULTS
49,028 articles were identified after matching the hand search records with the data downloaded from MEDLINE, of which 366 (0.75%) were classified as qualitative. Combinations of search terms reached peak sensitivities of 95%. Compared with the best single term, a three-term strategy increased sensitivity for qualitative studies by 23.6% (absolute increase), but with some loss of specificity when sensitivity was maximized. When search terms were combined to optimize sensitivity and specificity, both these values peaked above 90%.

66,75de569619fa030fecb606dddaaeacf9ca062b87,Architecture for Knowledge-Based and Federated Search of Online Clinical Evidence,"Background It is increasingly difficult for clinicians to keep up-to-date with the rapidly growing biomedical literature. Online evidence retrieval methods are now seen as a core tool to support evidence-based health practice. However, standard search engine technology is not designed to manage the many different types of evidence sources that are available or to handle the very different information needs of various clinical groups, who often work in widely different settings. Objectives The objectives of this paper are (1) to describe the design considerations and system architecture of a wrapper-mediator approach to federate search system design, including the use of knowledge-based, meta-search filters, and (2) to analyze the implications of system design choices on performance measurements. Methods A trial was performed to evaluate the technical performance of a federated evidence retrieval system, which provided access to eight distinct online resources, including e-journals, PubMed, and electronic guidelines. The Quick Clinical system architecture utilized a universal query language to reformulate queries internally and utilized meta-search filters to optimize search strategies across resources. We recruited 227 family physicians from across Australia who used the system to retrieve evidence in a routine clinical setting over a 4-week period. The total search time for a query was recorded, along with the duration of individual queries sent to different online resources. Results Clinicians performed 1662 searches over the trial. The average search duration was 4.9 ± 3.2 s (N = 1662 searches). Mean search duration to the individual sources was between 0.05 s and 4.55 s. Average system time (ie, system overhead) was 0.12 s. Conclusions The relatively small system overhead compared to the average time it takes to perform a search for an individual source shows that the system achieves a good trade-off between performance and reliability. Furthermore, despite the additional effort required to incorporate the capabilities of each individual source (to improve the quality of search results), system maintenance requires only a small additional overhead.",Journal of medical Internet research,2005.0,43.0,"['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '145948914', 'name': 'E.

Checking reference lists to identify relevant studies for systematic reviews is frequently recommended by systematic review manuals and is often undertaken by review authors. To date, no systematic review has explicitly examined the effectiveness of checking reference lists as a method to supplement electronic searching.


OBJECTIVES
To investigate the effectiveness of checking reference lists for the identification of additional, relevant studies for systematic reviews. Effectiveness is defined as the proportion of relevant studies identified by review authors solely by checking reference lists.


SEARCH STRATEGY
We searched the databases of The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2008), Library and Information Science abstracts (LISA) (1969 to July 2008) and MEDLINE (1966 to July 2008). We contacted experts in systematic review methods and examined reference lists of articles.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Studies of any design which examined checking reference lists as a search method for systematic reviews in any area. The primary outcome was the additional yield of relevant studies (i.e. studies not found through any other search methodologies); other outcomes were publication types identified and data pertaining to the costs (e.g. cost-effectiveness, cost-efficiency) of checking reference lists.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
We summarized data descriptively.


MAIN RESULTS
We included 12 studies (in 13 publications) in this review, but interpretability and generalizability of these studies is difficult and the study designs used were at high risk of bias. The additional yield (calculated by dividing the additional 'unique' yield identified by checking reference lists by the total number of studies found to be eligible within the study) of relevant studies identified through checking reference lists ranged from 2.5% to 42.7%. Only two studies reported yield information by publication type (dissertations and systematic reviews). No cost data were reported although one study commented that it was impossible to isolate the time spent on reference tracking since this was done in parallel with the critical appraisal of each paper, and for that particular study costs were not specifically estimated.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
There is some evidence to support the use of checking reference lists for locating studies in systematic reviews. However, this evidence is derived from weak study designs. In situations where the identification of all relevant studies through handsearching and database searching is difficult, it would seem prudent that authors of reviews check reference lists to supplement their searching. The challenge, therefore, is for review authors to recognize those situations.",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2011.0,224.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '5912515', 'name': 'T.

For several years we have been warned of the internet's rapid growth and potential to spread poor information to the public.1 Now there are anecdotes of patients coming to harm because of information obtained on the internet.2 Are we witnessing the beginning of an epidemic of misinformation or nothing more than a variation of what is endemic? Patients have always obtained information outside the formal healthcare system. Perhaps now there is simply a new carrier called the internet, and nothing else has changed?

The truth is we know very little about epidemiology in medical informatics, so it is hard to identify which information processes lead to unfavourable health outcomes. Encouragingly, new studies show surprising regularities when we look at population behaviour on the internet.3 Perhaps we will soon inject information “tracers” into our information and communication systems and observe their effect as they course though the social decision making apparatus.

QUESTION/SETTING: Although the systematic review has become a research standard, little information addresses the actions of the librarian on a systematic review team.


METHOD
This article is an observational case study that chronicles a librarian's required involvement, skills, and responsibilities in each stage of a real-life systematic review.


MAIN RESULTS
Examining the review process reveals that the librarian's multiple roles as an expert searcher, organizer, and analyzer form an integral part of the Cochrane Collaboration's criteria for conducting systematic reviews. Moreover, the responsibilities of the expert searcher directly reflect the key skills and knowledge depicted in the ""Definition of Expert Searching"" section of the Medical Library Association's policy statement, ""Role of Expert Searching in Health Sciences Libraries.""


CONCLUSION
Although the librarian's multiple roles are important in all forms of medical research, they are crucial in a systematic review. As an expert searcher, the librarian must interact with the investigators to develop the terms required for a comprehensive search strategy in multiple appropriate sources. As an organizer and analyzer, the librarian must effectively manage the articles and document the search, retrieval, and archival processes.",Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA,2005.0,95.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '20469883', 'name': 'M.

Since they are designed to minimize bias and subjectivity, they are a preferred option to assess the comparative effectiveness and safety of healthcare interventions. However, producing systematic reviews and keeping them up-to-date is becoming increasingly onerous for three reasons. First, the body of biomedical literature is expanding exponentially with no indication of slowing down. Second, as systematic reviews gain wide acceptance, they are also being used to address more complex questions (e.g., evaluating the comparative effectiveness of many interventions together rather than focusing only on pairs of interventions). Third, the standards for performing systematic reviews have become substantially more rigorous over time. To address these challenges, we must carefully prioritize the questions that should be addressed by systematic reviews and optimize the processes of research synthesis. In addition to reducing the workload involved in planning and conducting systematic reviews, we also need to make efforts to increase the transparency, reliability and validity of the review process; these aims can be grouped under the umbrella of 'modernization' of the systematic review process.",Journal of comparative effectiveness research,2013.0,45.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '1912476', 'name': 'Byron C.

However, no consensus regarding the methods to find duplicates has been provided. This study aims to describe a pragmatic strategy of combining auto- and hand-searching duplicates in systematic review and to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of duplicates. Methods and Findings Literatures regarding portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) were searched by the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases. Duplicates included one index paper and one or more redundant papers. They were divided into type-I (duplicates among different databases) and type-II (duplicate publications in different journals/issues) duplicates. For type-I duplicates, reference items were further compared between index and redundant papers. Of 10936 papers regarding PVT, 2399 and 1307 were identified as auto- and hand-searched duplicates, respectively. The prevalence of auto- and hand-searched redundant papers was 11.0% (1201/10936) and 6.1% (665/10936), respectively. They included 3431 type-I and 275 type-II duplicates. Of 11403 papers regarding BCS, 3275 and 2064 were identified as auto- and hand-searched duplicates, respectively. The prevalence of auto- and hand-searched redundant papers was 14.4% (1640/11403) and 9.1% (1039/11403), respectively. They included 5053 type-I and 286 type-II duplicates. Most of type-I duplicates were identified by auto-searching method (69.5%, 2385/3431 in PVT literatures; 64.6%, 3263/5053 in BCS literatures). Nearly all type-II duplicates were identified by hand-searching method (94.9%, 261/275 in PVT literatures; 95.8%, 274/286 in BCS literatures). Compared with those identified by auto-searching method, type-I duplicates identified by hand-searching method had a significantly higher prevalence of wrong items (47/2385 versus 498/1046, p<0.0001 in PVT literatures; 30/3263 versus 778/1790, p<0.0001 in BCS literatures).

Individuals and groups who write systematic reviews and meta-analyses in evidence-based medicine regularly carry out literature searches across multiple search engines linked to different bibliographic databases, and thus have an urgent need for a suitable metasearch engine to save time spent on repeated searches and to remove duplicate publications from initial consideration. Unlike general users who generally carry out searches to find a few highly relevant (or highly recent) articles, systematic reviewers seek to obtain a comprehensive set of articles on a given topic, satisfying specific criteria. This creates special requirements and challenges for metasearch engine design and implementation.",Health Inf. Sci.

The authors developed a tool to assess the quality of search filters designed to retrieve records for studies with specific research designs (e.g., diagnostic studies).


METHODS
The UK InterTASC Information Specialists' Sub-Group (ISSG), a group of experienced health care information specialists, reviewed the literature to evaluate existing search filter appraisal tools and determined that existing tools were inadequate for their needs. The group held consensus meetings to develop a new filter appraisal tool consisting of a search filter appraisal checklist and a structured abstract. ISSG members tested the final checklist using three published search filters.


RESULTS
The detailed ISSG Search Filter Appraisal Checklist captures relevance criteria and methods used to develop and test search filters. The checklist includes categorical and descriptive responses and is accompanied by a structured abstract that provides a summary of key quality features of a filter.


DISCUSSION
The checklist is a comprehensive appraisal tool that can assist health sciences librarians and others in choosing search filters. The checklist reports filter design methods and search performance measures, such as sensitivity and precision. The checklist can also aid filter developers by indicating information on core methods that should be reported to help assess filter suitability. The generalizability of the checklist for non-methods filters remains to be explored.",Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA,2008.0,57.0,"['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '47551843', 'name': 'J.

The resulting network of citations would also provide an alternative search method for clinicians, researchers, and systematic reviewers seeking to base decisions on all available evidence. We sought to determine the connectedness of citation networks of RCTs by examining direct (referenced trials) and indirect (through references of referenced trials, etc) citation of trials to one another. Methods Meta-analyses were used to create citation networks of RCTs addressing the same clinical questions. The primary measure was the proportion of networks where following citation links between RCTs identifies the complete set of RCTs, forming a single connected citation group. Other measures included the number of disconnected groups (islands) within each network, the number of citations in the network relative to the maximum possible, and the maximum number of links in the path between two connected trials (a measure of indirectness of citations). Results We included 259 meta-analyses with a total of 2,413 and a median of seven RCTs each. For 46% (118 of 259) of networks, the RCTs formed a single connected citation group—one island. For the other 54% of networks, where at least one RCT group was not cited by others, 39% had two citation islands and 4% (10 of 257) had 10 or more islands. On average, the citation networks had 38% of the possible citations to other trials (if each trial had cited all earlier trials). The number of citation islands and the maximum number of citation links increased with increasing numbers of trials in the network. Conclusion Available evidence to answer a clinical question may be identified by using network citations created with a small initial corpus of eligible trials. However, the number of islands means that citation networks cannot be relied on for evidence retrieval.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,2014.0,26.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '34867787', 'name': 'K.

However, producing SRs is resource-intensive, and progress in the research they review leads to SRs becoming outdated, requiring updates. Although the question of how and when to update SRs has been studied, the best method for determining when to update is still unclear, necessitating further research. In this work we study the potential impact of a machine learning-based automated system for providing alerts when new publications become available within an SR topic. Some of these new publications are especially important, as they report findings that are more likely to initiate a review update. To this end, we have designed a classification algorithm to identify articles that are likely to be included in an SR update, along with an annotation scheme designed to identify the most important publications in a topic area. Using an SR database containing over 70,000 articles, we annotated articles from 9 topics that had received an update during the study period. The algorithm was then evaluated in terms of the overall correct and incorrect alert rate for publications meeting the topic inclusion criteria, as well as in terms of its ability to identify important, update-motivating publications in a topic area. Our initial approach, based on our previous work in topic-specific SR publication classification, identifies over 70% of the most important new publications, while maintaining a low overall alert rate. We performed an initial analysis of the opportunities and challenges in aiding the SR update planning process with an informatics-based machine learning approach. Alerts could be a useful tool in the planning, scheduling, and allocation of resources for SR updates, providing an improvement in timeliness and coverage for the large number of medical topics needing SRs. While the performance of this initial method is not perfect, it could be a useful supplement to current approaches to scheduling an SR update. Approaches specifically targeting the types of important publications identified by this work are likely to improve results.",BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,2012.0,52.0,"['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '1755169', 'name': 'A.

In return for the altruism and trust that make clinical research possible, the research enterprise has an obligation to conduct research ethically and to report it honestly. Honest reporting begins with revealing the existence of all clinical studies, even those that reflect unfavorably on a research sponsor’s product.

Embase (Excerpta Medica) includes approximately 3500 journals, including many non-English language journals. Thus it is logical to hypothesize that the comprehensiveness of any systematic review may be enhanced by thoroughly searching both databases, rather than just one or the other. The degree to which this is true is not presently clear. Objective: To ascertain the degree of overlap and the unique contributions of Medline and Embase in identifying randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the effectiveness of educational interventions in improving asthma-related outcomes. Methods: Electronic searches of the Medline (1966 - April 1995) and Embase (1980-April 1995) databases were conducted, based on the standard Cochrane Collaboration search strategy for RCTs (1994 Cochrane Collaboration Handbook, Chapter V) in combination with ""and asthma"" and ""and education"". Results: A total of 205 citations were retrieved. Of these 205 citations, 144 were in Medline and 105 in Embase, constituting 70.7% and 51.2% hit ratios, respectively. There were a total of 44 duplicate records (21.5% of the entire 205). Medline contributed 100 (or 48.8%) of the unique records, while Embase contributed 61 (or 29.8%). Discussion: While there is some overlap in the retrieval of citations from electronic searches of Medline and Embase, anywhere from 29-48% of the potential RCTs on the effectiveness of educational interventions on asthma-related outcomes reported between 1966-April 1995 would have been missed had the search been limited to either one of the two databases. While it is likely that not all of these citations are true RCTs, past experience suggests that hand searching of relevant journals would yield additional true RCTs that were not indexed as such in either database. Reasons for the uniqueness in retrieval of the two databases may be a function of coverage of different journals and how they are indexed, the fact that Medline goes back further in time, as well as other factors.",,1995.0,3.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '2060227299', 'name': 'F.

One research focus is Open Information Extraction (OIE) aimed at developing relation-independent information extraction. Open Information Extraction systems seek to extract all potential relations from the text rather than extracting a few pre-defined relations. Existing Open Information Extraction systems have mainly focused on Web's heterogeneity rather than the Web's informality. The performance of the REVERB system, a state-of-the-art OIE system, drops dramatically as informality increases in Web documents.

This paper proposes a Hybrid Ripple-Down Rules based Open Information Extraction (Hybrid RDROIE) system, which uses RDR on top of a conventional OIE system. The Hybrid RDROIE system applies RDR's incremental learning technique as an add-on to the state-of-the-art REVERB OIE system to correct the performance degradation of REVERB due to the Web's informality in a domain of interest. With this wrapper approach, the baseline performance is that of the REVERB system with RDR correcting errors in a domain of interest. The Hybrid RDROIE system doubled REVERB's performance in a domain of interest after two hours training.",PKAW,2012.0,8.0,['Computer Science'],"[{'authorId': '2145932532', 'name': 'M.

The underlying idea of the system is to evaluate the citations of academic documents as language independent markers to detect plagiarism. CitePlag uses three different detection algorithms that analyze the citation sequence of academic documents for similar patterns that may indicate unduly used foreign text or ideas. The algorithms consider multiple citation-related factors such as proximity and order of citations within the text, or their probability of co-occurrence in order to compute document similarity scores. We present technical details of CitePlag’s detection algorithms and the acquisition of test data from the PubMed Central Open Access Subset. Future advancement of the prototype lies in increasing the reference database by enabling the system to process more document and citation formats. Improving CitePlag’s detection algorithms and scoring functions to reduce the number of false positives is another major goal.

Duplicate publication impacts the quality of the scientific corpus, has been difficult to detect, and studies this far have been limited in scope and size. Using text similarity searches, we were able to identify signatures of duplicate citations among a body of abstracts.


RESULTS
A sample of 62,213 Medline citations was examined and a database of manually verified duplicate citations was created to study author publication behavior. We found that 0.04% of the citations with no shared authors were highly similar and are thus potential cases of plagiarism. 1.35% with shared authors were sufficiently similar to be considered a duplicate. Extrapolating, this would correspond to 3500 and 117,500 duplicate citations in total, respectively.

Objective The aim was to determine long-term use of an online evidence system in routine clinical practice. Methods This was a prospective cohort study. 59 clinicians who had a computer with Internet access in their consulting room participated in a 12-month trial of Quick Clinical, an online evidence system specifically designed around the needs of general practitioners (GPs). Patterns of use were determined by examination of computer logs and survey analysis. Results On average, 9.9 searches were conducted by each GP in the first 2 months of the study. After this, usage dropped to 4.4 searches per GP in the third month and then levelled off to between 0.4 and 2.6 searches per GP per month. The majority of searches (79.2%, 2013/2543) were conducted during practice hours (between 9 am and 5 pm) and on weekdays (90.7%, 2315/2543).

We explored the use of various features based on lexical, semantic, structural, and sequential information in the data, using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for classification. For the classification tasks over all labels, our systems achieved micro-averaged f-scores of 80.9% and 66.9% over datasets of structured and unstructured abstracts respectively, using sequential features. In labeling only the key sentences, our systems produced f-scores of 89.3% and 74.0% over structured and unstructured abstracts respectively, using the same sequential features. The results over an external dataset were lower (f-scores of 63.1% for all labels, and 83.8% for key sentences). Of the features we used, the best for classifying any given sentence in an abstract were based on unigrams, section headings, and sequential information from preceding sentences. These features resulted in improved performance over a simple bag-of-words approach, and outperformed feature sets used in previous work.",BMC Bioinformatics,2011.0,170.0,"['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '1736741380', 'name': 'Su Nam Kim'}, {'authorId': '143696281', 'name': 'David Martínez'}, {'authorId': '1788025', 'name': 'L.

Systematic reviews of the literature are an important resource for clinicians. Unfortunately, the few published strategies for identifying these articles involve MEDLINE interfaces not widely available outside of academic medicine. In addition, the performance of these strategies is unknown.


OBJECTIVE
To develop and evaluate a search strategy for identifying systematic reviews by using a publicly available MEDLINE interface (PubMed).


DESIGN
Diagnostic test assessment. DEFINITION OF SENSITIVITY: The proportion of recognized systematic reviews (indexed in the Cochrane Library's Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness [DARE] or in ACP Journal Club) that are identified by the search strategy. DEFINITION OF POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE: The proportion of articles identified in one of three sample searches (screening for colorectal cancer, thrombolytic therapy for venous thromboembolism, and treatment of dementia) that meet a minimum definition of systematic review.


RESULTS
Our PubMed search strategy identified 93 of 100 DARE-indexed systematic reviews, a sensitivity of 93% (95% CI, 86% to 97%). For the sample of systematic reviews drawn from ACP Journal Club (n = 103), the PubMed strategy achieved a sensitivity of 97% (CI, 91% to 99%). When the three sample search strings were used, approximately 50% of retrieved articles met our minimum definition of systematic review. In contrast, the similar precision of a PubMed search restricted to review-type articles (as indexed by MEDLINE) was less than 10%.


CONCLUSIONS
This search strategy identified most systematic reviews without over-whelming users with numerous false-positive results. A ""single-click"" filter based on this strategy is now available as part of the Clinical Queries feature of PubMed.",Effective clinical practice : ECP,2001.0,158.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '1764335', 'name': 'K.

98,ab88f3c241fddd2f756dfcf26bb7d65e09009afe,Formulating Questions and Locating Primary Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews,"A good systematic review is based on a well-formulated, answerable question. The question guides the review by defining which studies will be included, what the search strategy to identify the relevant primary studies should be, and which data need to be extracted from each study. Ask a poor question and you will get a poor review. A clear question also helps the reader rapidly assess whether the review is relevant to his or her own clinical practice. I discuss where good questions come from, how to choose an important question, how to formulate the question properly to get an answer with an appropriate level of detail, and how to develop a search strategy to identify relevant studies. Where Do Questions Come From? Questions arise constantly in routine clinical practice, provided that clinicians are prepared to admit their own level of uncertainty or lack of knowledge [1]. The most relevant questions are often asked directly or indirectly by patients [2, 3]. Most clinical encounters generate questions about diagnosis (What do I have, doctor?), etiology (Is it because I did X?), prognosis (How long do I have?), or treatment or prevention (Will Y do me any good?). The ways in which different clinicians manage the same clinical problem vary widely, both within and between countries; these variations should raise questions about which management policies are best. The introduction of new treatments or diagnostic tests should always lead to the question, Are they better than what we have already? Researchers who are planning new studies must consider whether the answer to their question already exists, whereas purchasers of health care must ask which health care packages they should buy. Systematic reviews of all available information would help in each of these situations. Choosing an Important Question The number of possible questions for systematic reviews is limitless, but the time and resources with which to answer them are limited. Therefore, researchers who undertake systematic reviews must choose the most important questions. This is difficult because the importance of a question varies according to the perspective of the person asking it. For example, individual patients will probably regard questions about their conditions as the most important, regardless of how common or severe that condition is, whereas cardiologists will prefer questions about ischemic heart disease to those about migraine. Cancer and vascular disease are particularly important to persons in developed countries, whereas infectious diseases are more important to persons in developing countries. These differences highlight the need for each specialty to organize its own systematic reviews. Several factors should be considered when setting priorities for doing systematic reviews [4-8] (Table 1). Table 1. Factors To Consider When Determining the Importance of a Question as the Basis for a Systematic Review Important questions may deal with conditions that have a major effect on patients or on persons who care for them, such as conditions associated with serious illness (diabetes), death (cancer), or with impaired quality of life (back pain). Very common conditions may have a major effect on society even if they are minor and short-lived (such as the common cold, which results in many aggregate days of missed work). Most health care interventions have potentially harmful effects and should be carefully evaluated. It is particularly important to assess expensive interventions (for example, interferon therapy for multiple sclerosis [9]); widely used interventions, because these may cause widespread harm (for example, lignocaine in acute myocardial infarction [10]); and simple interventions that could be widely used if they are shown to be effective (such as steroids for preterm delivery [11]). The most useful reviews are those that can improve clinical practice. Widespread change is more likely to occur if collective uncertainty exists; this uncertainty is often reflected in variations in practice. Asking a question that has already been answered by common sense or by powerful empirical evidence is of little use unless evidence suggests that the existing answer is wrong. It is also difficult to influence well-established practices, even if the evidence for their utility is poor (for example, cervical screening programs); new technologies must therefore be assessed early in their development. Some researchers consider it more important to concentrate on questions for which data are known to exist [4, 5], but this reasoning may be flawed. A thorough search often identifies previously unknown data or a lack of useful data for some important questions, thereby demonstrating the need for future research. Although the factors in Table 1 primarily concern the assessment of health technology, most also apply to prioritizing questions about risk or prognostic factors (that is, the frequency, reversibility, and measurability of the factors). Clearly, many of the factors are relatively subjective (such as effect on the patient), thereby underscoring the need to involve patients in setting priorities [2, 3]. Formulating the Question Having decided that a question is worth asking, the next step is to formulate it adequately (Figure 1). Clinical questions should have four basic components [12]: the type of person involved, the type of exposure that the person experiences (be it a risk factor, prognostic factor, intervention, or diagnostic test), the type of control with which the exposure is being compared, and the outcomes to be addressed. Figure 1. Examples of poorly formulated and well-formulated questions. A clearly formulated question helps define the criteria that studies must meet to be included in the review (Figure 2). These inclusion criteria can be divided into five categories, shown in Table 2. Each component must be carefully defined to strike a balance between making the definition too specific to be workable and making it too broad to be useful. In Figure 2, the definition of ischemic stroke could be a stroke with an occluded artery on angiography; this definition, however, would exclude most studies because few patients with stroke undergo angiography. Alternatively, it could be defined simply as ischemic cerebrovascular disease, but it then becomes unclear whether patients with transient ischemic attacks and vascular dementia are included. Some complex exposures or interventions can be difficult to define precisely, especially if they are nonpharmacologic (for example, how does one define speech therapy?). In this situation, it may be useful to begin with a broad working definition that can later be refined and to test the reproducibility of the definition among different types of persons (for example, speech therapy could be defined as therapy given by a qualified speech therapist to improve language function). It is also important to remember that definitions may very among countries and among studies (for example, the term chronic cerebrovascular disease is sometimes used to mean vascular dementia). Figure 2. How a well-formulated question guides the review process. Table 2. Categories of Inclusion Criteria Appendix Table. Example of a MEDLINE Search for Studies of Anticoagulant Agents in Acute Ischemic Stroke The outcomes to be assessed should be clinically relevant to the patient [13]. They must consider the perspective of the patient because physicians and patients often do not agree on what issues are important [2, 3]. Indirect or surrogate outcome measures, such as laboratory or radiologic results, should be avoided or interpreted with extreme caution because they rarely predict clinically important outcomes accurately [14]. Surrogate measures may tell you how a treatment might work but not whether it actually does work. Many treatments reduce the risk for a surrogate outcome but have no effect or have harmful effects on clinically relevant outcomes, and some treatments have no effect on surrogate measures but improve clinical outcomes [14]. For example, lignocaine has been shown to suppress ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction [15] but increases case-fatality rates [10]. Systematic reviews of treatments should measure adverse effects as well as beneficial effects. Reviewers may also wish to record data on costs to perform an economic evaluation, although this requires expert guidance [16]. In addition to defining the outcomes that are to be measured, the inclusion criteria must state when the outcomes should be measured. For chronic diseases, outcomes that are assessed after a short follow-up period may not reflect long-term outcome. Reviews should always focus on the best available evidence: that is, studies to be included in a review should use methods that provide the least biased answer to the question asked. Therefore, systematic reviews of treatment and prevention should include randomized, controlled trials [17], particularly those that use a well-concealed method of allocation [18]. Reviews of diagnostic tests should include studies that independently compared one or more tests with an adequate gold standard [19, 20]. Reviews of prognosis should include cohort studies in which a representative sample of patients was entered at a similar point in the course of disease [21]. Finally, reviews of risk factors could include relevant casecontrol, cohort, or ecologic studies, ideally with multivariate analysis to adjust for other known risk factors. If no studies providing the best level of evidence are found, it may be appropriate to consider other levels of evidence. For example, no evidence from randomized, controlled trials suggests that lying babies supine rather than prone prevents the sudden infant death syndrome, but a substantial body of observational data suggests that this is the case [22]. Other details that must be considered are the requirement for blinding in randomized, controlled trials [18] and ",Annals of Internal Medicine,1997.0,452.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '4185737', 'name': 'C.

As part of this process, the phase of screening articles usually requires a long time and significant effort as it involves a group of domain experts evaluating thousands of articles in order to find the relevant instances. Our goal is to support this process through automatic tools. There is a recent trend of applying text classification methods to semi-automate the screening phase by providing decision support to the group of experts, hence helping reduce the required time and effort. In this work, we contribute to this line of work by performing a comprehensive set of text classification experiments on a corpus resulting from an actual systematic review in the area of Internet-Based Randomised Controlled Trials. These experiments involved applying multiple machine learning algorithms combined with several feature selection techniques to different parts of the articles (i.e., titles, abstract, or both). Results are generally positive in terms of overall precision and recall measurements, reaching values of up to 84%. It is also revealing in terms of how using only article titles provides virtually as good results as when adding article abstracts. Based on the positive results, it is clear that text classification can support the screening stage of medical systematic reviews . However, selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithms, related methods, and text sections of articles is a neglected but important requirement because of its significant impact to the end results.",Expert Syst.

It is necessary to invest in strategies that allow access to reliable and updated evidence on which to base health decisions. The objective is to develop and evaluate a strategy for building the capacity among different actors of a country’s health system to implement the model known as “Living Evidence” [LE] in the evidence synthesis and dissemination of knowledge transfer [KT] products to inform health decisions. The study will involve professional members of health system organizations in charge of developing KT products to inform health decisions. The project will be developed in three complementary phases: 1) LE-implementation framework development through review of the literature, brainstorming meetings, user testing, and expert consultation; 2) training in LE tools and strategies; 3) developing LE synthesis for KT products by applying the framework to real-life diverse situations. To achieve the capacity-building strategy assessment goal, several surveys and interviews will take place during the process to assess: 1) the LE-implementation framework for the incorporation of LE synthesis in the development of KT products; 2) the training workshops; 3) the whole capacity-building strategy used for health system organizations be able of implementing the LE as part of the KT products they regularly produce. The expected results are an effective capacity-building strategy for health system organizations to implement the living evidence model in different KT products; a LE-implementation framework to be applicable to any country or region to incorporate LE in the KT products; LE synthesis for KT products directly applicable to the real-setting situations; integration of Epistemonikos-L.OVE platform for keeping the LE process in the development and updating of KT products.",Open Research Europe,2022.0,0.0,,"[{'authorId': '1398930921', 'name': 'M.

We introduce a new open-source framework for systematic reviews that significantly reduces time and human resource allocation for collecting and screening scientific literature. The framework provides three main tools: 1) an automatic citation search engine and manager that collects records from multiple online sources with a unified query syntax, 2) a Bayesian, active machine learning, citation screening tool based on iterative human-machine interaction to increase predictive accuracy and, 3) a semi-automatic, data-driven query generator to create new search queries from existing citation data sets. To evaluate the automatic screener’s performance, we estimated the median posterior sensitivity and efficiency [90% Credible Intervals] using Bayesian simulation to predict the distribution of undetected potentially relevant records. Tested on an example topic, the framework collected 17,755 unique records through the citation manager; 766 records required human evaluation while the rest were excluded by the automatic classifier; the theoretical efficiency was 95.6% [95.3%, 95.7%] with a sensitivity of 100% [93.5%, 100%]. A new search query was generated from the labelled dataset, and 82,579 additional records were collected; only 567 records required human review after automatic screening, and six additional positive matches were found.

It involves evidence production (design and conducting of clinical studies), synthesis (collecting, appraising, and combining data to answer clinical questions), implementation (e.g., through clinical practice guidelines based on these syntheses), and evaluation (monitoring the quality of care, including adherence to evidence-based recommendations).EBM faces many challenges that artificial intelligence can help solve. It can help detect research gaps and avoid funding redundant studies. It can expedite the evidence synthesis process, which currently is slow and costly, leading to outdated and incomplete evidence being used in the decision-making processes. AI can help engage patients and elicit values (e.g., chatbot-based decision aids) as well as provide coordinated care for patients with multimorbidities.However, improperly implementing AI can also exacerbate problems in EBM.

We aim to investigate the application and accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for automated medical literature screening for systematic reviews.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and IEEE Xplore Digital Library to identify potentially relevant studies. We included studies in automated literature screening that reported study question, source of dataset, and developed algorithm models for literature screening. The literature screening results by human investigators were considered to be the reference standard. Quantitative synthesis of the accuracy was conducted using a bivariate model.


RESULTS
Eighty-six studies were included in our systematic review and 17 studies were further included for meta-analysis. The combined recall, specificity, and precision were 0.928 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.878-0.958], 0.647 (95% CI, 0.442-0.809), and 0.200 (95% CI, 0.135-0.287) when achieving maximized recall, but were 0.708 (95% CI, 0.570-0.816), 0.921 (95% CI, 0.824-0.967), and 0.461 (95% CI, 0.375-0.549) when achieving maximized precision in the AI models. No significant difference was found in recall among subgroup analyses including the algorithms, the number of screened literatures, and the fraction of included literatures.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
This systematic review and meta-analysis study showed that the recall is more important than the specificity or precision in literature screening, and a recall over 0.95 should be prioritized. We recommend to report the effectiveness indices of automatic algorithms separately. At the current stage manual literature screening is still indispensable for medical systematic reviews.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2022.0,0.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '2046769594', 'name': 'Yunying Feng'}, {'authorId': '1400402897', 'name': 'Siyu Liang'}, {'authorId': '2145912876', 'name': 'Yuelun Zhang'}, {'authorId': '153064582', 'name': 'Shi Chen'}, {'authorId': '41097357', 'name': 'Qing Wang'}, {'authorId': '2167497512', 'name': 'Tianze Huang'}, {'authorId': '144455177', 'name': 'F.

Automated summaries can be designed to identify and extract details of interest pertaining to the study design, population, testing agent/intervention, or outcome (etc.). Much of the data reported across existing publications lack unified structure, standardization and machine-readable formats or may be presented in complex tables which serve as barriers that impede the development of automated data extraction methodologies. As full automation of data extraction seems unlikely soon, encouraging investigators to submit structured summaries of methods and results in standardized formats with meta-data tagging of content may be of value during the publication process. This would produce machine-readable content to facilitate automated data extraction, establish sharable data repositories, help make research data FAIR, and could improve reporting quality. <h3>Objectives</h3> A pilot study was conducted to assess the feasibility of asking participants to summarize study methods and results using a structured, web-based data extraction model as a potential workflow that could be implemented during the manuscript submission process. <h3>Methods</h3> Eight participants entered study details and data into the Health Assessment Workplace Collaborative (HAWC). Participants were surveyed after the extraction exercise to ascertain 1) whether this extraction exercise will impact their conducting and reporting of future research, 2) the ease of data extraction, including which fields were easiest and relatively more problematic to extract and 3) the amount of time taken to perform data extractions and other related tasks. Investigators then presented participants the potential benefits of providing structured data in the format they were extracting. After this, participants were surveyed about 1) their willingness to provide structured data during the publication process and 2) whether they felt the potential application of structured data entry approaches and their implementation during the journal submission process should continue to be further explored. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Routine provision of structured data that summarizes key information from research studies could reduce the amount of effort required for reusing that data in the future, such as in systematic reviews or agency scientific assessments. Our pilot study suggests that directly asking authors to provide that data, via structured templates, may be a viable approach to achieving this: participants were willing to do so, and the overall process was not prohibitively arduous. We also found some support for the hypothesis that use of study templates may have halo benefits in improving the conduct and completeness of reporting of future research.

Multiple approaches to automate it using various machine learning techniques have been proposed. The first research papers that apply deep neural networks to this problem were published in the last two years. In this work, we conduct a replicability study of the first two deep learning papers for citation screening [8, 16] and evaluate their performance on 23 publicly available datasets. While we succeeded in replicating the results of one of the papers, we were unable to replicate the results of the other. We summarise the challenges involved in the replication, including difficulties in obtaining the datasets to match the experimental setup of the original papers and problems with executing the original source code. Motivated by this experience, we subsequently present a simpler model based on averaging word embeddings that outperforms one of the models on 18 out of 23 datasets and is, on average, 72 times faster than the second replicated approach. Finally, we measure the training time and the invariance of the models when exposed to a variety of input features and random initialisations, demonstrating differences in the robustness of these approaches.KeywordsCitation screeningStudy selectionSystematic literature review (SLR)Document retrievalReplicability",ECIR,2022.0,0.0,['Computer Science'],"[{'authorId': '50320098', 'name': 'Wojciech Kusa'}, {'authorId': '1699657', 'name': 'A.

We evaluated the application of AI tools in COVID-19 evidence syntheses.After prospective registration of the review protocol, we automated the download of all open-access COVID-19 systematic reviews in the COVID-19 Living Overview of Evidence database, indexed them for AI-related keywords, and located those that used AI tools. We compared their journals' JCR Impact Factor, citations per month, screening workloads, completion times (from pre-registration to preprint or submission to a journal) and AMSTAR-2 methodology assessments (maximum score 13 points) with a set of publication date matched control reviews without AI.Of the 3999 COVID-19 reviews, 28 (0.7%, 95% CI 0.47-1.03%) made use of AI. On average, compared to controls (n=64), AI reviews were published in journals with higher Impact Factors (median 8.9 vs 3.5, p<0.001), and screened more abstracts per author (302.2 vs 140.3, p=0.009) and per included study (189.0 vs 365.8, p<0.001) while inspecting less full texts per author (5.3 vs 14.0, p=0.005).

Here, we evaluate a proposed automated probabilistic publication type screening strategy applied to the randomized controlled trial (RCT) articles (i.e., those which present clinical outcome results of RCT studies) included in a corpus of previously published Cochrane reviews. Materials and Methods We selected a random subset of 558 published Cochrane reviews that specified RCT study only inclusion criteria, containing 7113 included articles which could be matched to PubMed identifiers. These were processed by our automated RCT Tagger tool to estimate the probability that each article reports clinical outcomes of a RCT. Results Removing articles with low predictive scores P < 0.01 eliminated 288 included articles, of which only 22 were actually typical RCT articles, and only 18 were actually typical RCT articles that MEDLINE indexed as such. Based on our sample set, this screening strategy led to fewer than 0.05 relevant RCT articles being missed on average per Cochrane SR. Discussion This scenario, based on real SRs, demonstrates that automated tagging can identify RCT articles accurately while maintaining very high recall. However, we also found that even SRs whose inclusion criteria are restricted to RCT studies include not only clinical outcome articles per se, but a variety of ancillary article types as well. Conclusions This encourages further studies learning how best to incorporate automated tagging of additional publication types into SR triage workflows.",JAMIA open,2022.0,1.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '1692044', 'name': 'Jodi Schneider'}, {'authorId': '2161190544', 'name': ',.

Many software tools exist to assist with SRs, but most tools do not support the full process, and transparency and replicability of SR depend on performing and presenting evidence according to established best practices. Objective This study aims to provide a basis for comparing and selecting between web-based software tools that support SR, by conducting a feature-by-feature comparison of SR tools. Methods We searched for SR tools by reviewing any such tool listed in the SR Toolbox, previous reviews of SR tools, and qualitative Google searching. We included all SR tools that were currently functional and required no coding, and excluded reference managers, desktop applications, and statistical software. The list of features to assess was populated by combining all features assessed in 4 previous reviews of SR tools; we also added 5 features (manual addition, screening automation, dual extraction, living review, and public outputs) that were independently noted as best practices or enhancements of transparency and replicability. Then, 2 reviewers assigned binary present or absent assessments to all SR tools with respect to all features, and a third reviewer adjudicated all disagreements. Results Of the 53 SR tools found, 55% (29/53) were excluded, leaving 45% (24/53) for assessment. In total, 30 features were assessed across 6 classes, and the interobserver agreement was 86.46%. DistillerSR (Evidence Partners; 26/30, 87%), Nested Knowledge (Nested Knowledge; 25/30, 83%), and EPPI-Reviewer Web (EPPI-Centre; 24/30, 80%) support the most features followed by Giotto Compliance (Giotto Compliance; 23/30, 77%), LitStream (ICF), and SRDB.PRO (VTS Software). Fewer than half of all the features assessed are supported by 7 tools: RobotAnalyst (National Centre for Text Mining), SRDR (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality), SyRF (Systematic Review Facility), Data Abstraction Assistant (Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health), SR Accelerator (Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare), RobotReviewer (RobotReviewer), and COVID-NMA (COVID-NMA). Notably, of the 24 tools, only 10 (42%) support direct search, only 7 (29%) offer dual extraction, and only 13 (54%) offer living/updatable reviews. Conclusions DistillerSR, Nested Knowledge, and EPPI-Reviewer Web each offer a high density of SR-focused web-based tools.

Many recent systematic literature review studies have discussed supply chain relationships from various perspectives. However, a comprehensive analysis, summarising the existing research, explicitly identified the implemented B2B supply chain relationships and found the effects of these relationships on supply chain performance remain lacking. To address the gap, this article presents a systematic literature review based on the PRISMA approach regarding the nature of the supply chain relationships between B2B partners and their effect on supply chain performance. Web of Science and Scopus were used in the compilation of studies published between 2000 and 2020. Findings indicate that the majority of B2B partners use a collaborative relationship approach and that the impacts are marked on the operational, financial, innovation, environmental, social and economic performance of their supply chain. This study seeks to contribute to the existing literature on B2B supply chain relationships by conducting a thorough and unbiased review of previous studies, drawing more general conclusions about the adopted supply chain relationships between B2B partners and providing insights for future research.",Sustainability,2021.0,0.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '102637809', 'name': 'F.

Emerging evidence suggests that consumption of high-fat, ketogenic diets (KD) may be advantageous for reducing body mass and FM, while retaining FFM. Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed and Cochrane Library databases to compare the effects of KD versus control diets (CON) on body mass and composition in physically active populations. Randomized and non-randomized studies were included if participants were healthy (free of chronic disease), physically active men or women age ≥ 18 years consuming KD ( 0.5 mmol/L) for ≥14 days. Results Thirteen studies (9 parallel and 4 crossover/longitudinal) that met the inclusion criteria were identified. Aggregated results from the 13 identified studies show body mass decreased 2.7 kg in KD and increased 0.3 kg in CON. FM decreased by 2.3 kg in KD and 0.3 kg in CON. FFM decreased by 0.3 kg in KD and increased 0.7 kg in CON. Estimated energy balance based on changes in body composition was - 339 kcal/d in KD and 5 kcal/d in CON. Risk of bias identified some concern of bias primarily due to studies which allowed participants to self-select diet intervention groups, as well as inability to blind participants to the study intervention, and/or longitudinal study design. Conclusion KD can promote mobilization of fat stores to reduce FM while retaining FFM. However, there is variance in results of FFM across studies and some risk-of-bias in the current literature that is discussed in this systematic review.",Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition,2021.0,4.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '2088408343', 'name': 'Julie L.

Many existing studies examined beneficial effects of acute exercise on subsequent set shifting performance in healthy adults. Set shifting, a subdomain of executive function, is the ability to switch between different cognitive sets. The results of existing studies are inconsistent. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted that pooled available effect sizes. Additionally, moderator analyses were carried out to identify covariates that determine the magnitude of exercise-induced set shifting benefits. Methods: Medline, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus were searched for eligible studies. Hedges' g corrected standardized mean difference values were used for analyses. Random-effects weights were applied to pool effects. Potential moderation of the effect of acute exercise on subsequent set shifting performance by exercise intensity, type of exercise, participants' age, and type of control group were examined. Results: Twenty-two studies (N = 1,900) were included into analysis. All aggregated effect sizes ranged from small to moderate. Overall, a small significant beneficial effect was revealed (g = −0.32, 95 % CI −0.45 to −0.18). Heterogeneity of included effect sizes was moderate and significant (T2 = 0.0715, I2 = 46.4%, (p < 0.0016). Moderator analyses revealed a larger average effect in older adults than for studies examining younger adults (−0.42 vs. −0.29). Light exercise (−0.51) led to larger effects than moderate (−0.24) or vigorous exercise (−0.29). Studies testing acute exercise against active control groups showed a noticeably smaller average effect (−0.13) than studies that used passive (−0.38) or cognitive engaging control groups (−0.34). Interestingly, application of resistance or aerobic exercise led to no different average effect sizes (−0.30 vs. −0.32). However, none of the tested covariates reached statistical significance. Conclusion: Acute exercise improves subsequent set shifting performance. However, effect sizes are small, making the relevance for everyday life questionable. The results indicate that older adults benefit more from acute exercise than younger adults do. Light intensity exercise seems most effective while the type of exercise does not seem to influence the magnitude of effects. Research designs with active control groups show the smallest average effect, raising concerns about placebo effects.

Thirty-two reported on the resource use—mostly time; four described reasons why steps of the review process are resource intensive. Study selection, data extraction, and critical appraisal seem to be very resource intensive, while protocol development, literature search, or study retrieval take less time. Project management and administration required a large proportion of SR production time. Lack of experience, domain knowledge, use of collaborative and SR-tailored software, and good communication and management can be reasons why SR steps are resource intensive.

This incredible rate of scientific productivity leads to information overload, making it difficult for researchers, clinicians and public health officials to keep up with the latest findings. Automated text mining techniques for searching, reading and summarizing papers are helpful for addressing information overload. In this review, we describe the many resources that have been introduced to support text mining applications over the COVID-19 literature; specifically, we discuss the corpora, modeling resources, systems and shared tasks that have been introduced for COVID-19. We compile a list of 39 systems that provide functionality such as search, discovery, visualization and summarization over the COVID-19 literature. For each system, we provide a qualitative description and assessment of the system’s performance, unique data or user interface features and modeling decisions. Many systems focus on search and discovery, though several systems provide novel features, such as the ability to summarize findings over multiple documents or linking between scientific articles and clinical trials. We also describe the public corpora, models and shared tasks that have been introduced to help reduce repeated effort among community members; some of these resources (especially shared tasks) can provide a basis for comparing the performance of different systems.

Stress can reduce the quality of parental care and may be linked to the deterioration of parents' and children's mental and physical health and family dynamics. No systematic literature review on parental stress in ophthalmology has been found to provide evidence synthesis capable of stimulating and defining new studies and thereby promoting research in this field. To address this important gap, the present review aims to synthesize evidence about approaches, methods, instruments, and results from research regarding ophthalmology-related parental stress. Methods Primary epidemiological observational studies should be original in addressing parental stress caused by ophthalmological health conditions in children. They should present the characteristics of the study population and the clinical and ophthalmic characterizations of children. MEDLINE (via Ovid), EMBASE, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and gray literature (PsycEXTRA, NTIS, and OpenSINGLE) will be searched. Controlled vocabulary, Boolean operators, and defined search strategies will be used. There will be no restrictions on the studies' publication language, which will be selected in two screening stages. Two reviewers will independently retrieve full-text studies, assess methodological quality, and extract data. Data available through December 2021 will be considered for inclusion.

To achieve this purpose we provided a descriptive profile of the interventions and strategies used at universities to organise and manage research, rather than the detailed examination of substantive research results. The method of descriptive content analysis was applied to analyse empirical, experimental, review, conceptual, and commentary sources revealing strategies of organising and managing research at universities. The growth and corporate type strategies are dominant at universities, particularly in the USA and EU. The universities mainly seek cost-effective research opportunities that can help the institutions build a strong international brand. The policy of institutional strategic research management aimed at cooperation in research with other sectors seems to be the most feasible and appropriate for the Ukrainian research management context. Creating project management communities was found to be the second most feasible and appropriate strategy of organising and managing the university research in Ukraine.

To improve the image of company as a socially responsible organization, corporate philanthropy activities need to be disclosed to stakeholders. There are several factors influencing the corporate philanthropy disclosure. In the current literature, there is still a lack of initiative to systematically review the disclosure of corporate philanthropy in annual reports. The aim of this study is to analyze the existing literature on factors influencing the corporate philanthropy disclosure by Malaysian companies. This paper was guided by the four phase of PRISMA Statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) review method and utilized Scopus and Web of Science as the main journal databases. This paper identified 17 related studies (out of 230 papers) that could be analyzed systematically. Most importantly, the review managed to formulate four main themes i.e., factors influencing the corporate philanthropy disclosure, namely ownership structure, board of directors’ characteristics, financial performance and ‘others’. These four themes further resulted in a total of 25 sub-themes. Finally, a number of recommendations were presented at the end of this research which corresponded to potential significant opportunities for future research, either quantitative or qualitative study. This study offers a guide for future studies and thus hopes to encourage more scholarly interest for this intriguing phenomenon at the crossroads of business and society. In the review, the studies included only articles that studied on corporate disclosure in annual reports of Malaysian companies. A comparison between two or more countries can also be conducted in contributing to the body of knowledge.","International Journal of Academic Research in Accounting, Finance and Management Sciences",2021.0,0.0,,"[{'authorId': '2139062721', 'name': 'Nurul Rafeah Mohamed Yusuf'}, {'authorId': '29078413', 'name': 'Corina Joseph'}]"

In the medical domain, complex Boolean queries are used to identify studies. To ensure comprehensiveness, all studies retrieved are screened for inclusion or exclusion in the review. Developing Boolean queries for this task requires the expertise of trained information specialists. However, even for these expert searchers, query formulation can be difficult and lengthy: especially when dealing with areas of medicine that they may not be knowledgeable about. To this end, two computational adaptations of methods information specialists use to formulate Boolean queries have been proposed in prior work. These adaptations can be used to assist information specialists by providing a good starting point for query development. However, a number of limitations with these computational methods have been raised, and a comparison between them has not been made. In this study, we address the limitations of previous work and evaluate the two. We found that, between the two computational adaptions, the objective method is more effective than the conceptual method for query formulation alone, however, the conceptual method provides a better starting point for manual query refinement.

Publicized failures to replicate landmark studies, along with high-profile cases of research fraud, have led scholars to reconsider the trustworthiness of both findings and institutionalized research practices. This paper considers two questions: (1) Relative to psychology and economics, what is the state of replication and reproduction research in management? (2) Are the disciplines equally advanced in the use of methods applied to study the replication problem? A systematic literature review identified 67 studies pertinent to these questions. The results indicate that the replication prevalence rate in management studies lies almost exactly between those of psychology and economics, while a high level of variation between management and other business-related disciplines can be noted. Further, similarly to psychology, but unlike economics, the surveys of published replications tend to report high replication success rates for management and other business-related disciplines. However, a comparison with recently obtained results in preregistered multi-study replications in psychology and economics suggests that these rates are almost certainly inflated. Method and data transparency are medium to low, often rendering attempts to reproduce or replicate studies impossible. Finally, the understanding of the replicability problem in management is held back by the underutilization of methods developed in other disciplines. The review also reveals that management, psychology, and economics exhibit strikingly different practices and approaches to replication, despite facing similar incentive structures. Disciplines in which replication and reproduction attempts are rare and which frequently involve authors of the original study in replication attempts lack strong deterrents against questionable research practices; thus, they are less likely to deliver replicable results.",,2021.0,4.0,['Psychology'],"[{'authorId': '98127959', 'name': 'P.

Significant research activities in the field of nanotechnology resulted in a huge number of publications in the last decades. However, even if the published data can provide relevant information, scientific articles are often of diverse quality, and it is nearly impossible to manually process and evaluate such amount of data in a systematic manner. In this feasibility study, we investigated to what extent open‐access automation tools can support a systematic review of toxic effects of nanomaterials for health applications reported in the scientific literature. In this study, we used a battery of available tools to perform the initial steps of a systematic review such as targeted searches, data curation and abstract screening. This work was complemented with an in‐house developed tool that allowed us to extract specific sections of the articles such as the materials and methods part or the results section where we could perform subsequent text analysis. We ranked the articles according to quality criteria based on the reported nanomaterial characterisation and extracted most frequently described toxic effects induced by different types of nanomaterials.

The communication strategies we describe engage teams through information, questions, and action items and lead to productive collaborations with publishable systematic reviews. Conclusions: Effective communication with review teams keeps systematic review projects moving forward. The techniques covered in this case study strive to minimize misunderstandings, educate collaborators, and, in our experience, have led to multiple successful collaborations and publications.

Computerised support of this screening process has been applied with varying success. This is partly due to the dependency on large amounts of data to develop models that predict inclusion. In this paper, we present an approach to choose which data to use in model training and compare it with established approaches. We used a dataset of 50 Cochrane diagnostic test accuracy reviews, and each was used as a target review. From the remaining 49 reviews, we selected those that most closely resembled the target review's clinical topic using the cosine similarity metric. Included and excluded studies from these selected reviews were then used to develop our prediction models. The performance of models trained on the selected reviews was compared against models trained on studies from all available reviews. The prediction models performed best with a larger number of reviews in the training set and on target reviews that had a research subject similar to other reviews in the dataset.

Although cognitive impairment (CI) is increasingly considered the main geriatric condition predisposing to dementia, its early management could still promote symptomatic relief and delay disease progression. Recently, probiotics treatment has been studied as a potential new therapeutic approach to attenuate dementia-related decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to review and analyse the available evidence on the effect of probiotics on MCI and dementia. Methods A systematic search and meta-analysis were performed on Cochrane Library, ProQuest, Web of Science, PubMed-Medline, The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, ScienceDirect and Open Grey. Search terms included diagnoses of interest (dementia and MCI) and the intervention of interest (probiotic, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium). Original articles reporting the use of probiotics supplementation for the treatment of dementia and MCI were screened and studied independently by two researchers. After that, a random and fixed effects model was used at the meta-analysis stage of the results to determine its effect size. Results A total of 16 articles (10 preclinical and 6 clinical) that met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review, and 15 articles (10 preclinical and 5 clinical) for meta-analysis were finally included. In humans, the administration of probiotics improved general cognitive function after the treatment period. Similarly, an improvement in memory and spatial/non-spatial learning was identified in the probiotic group of animals compared to the control group. On the other hand, the results showed an increase in the levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, an improvement in the inflammatory profile and regulation of cellular biomarkers after probiotics administration. Conclusion Probiotics supplementation could be an adequate therapeutic strategy both in dementia and CI based on clinical and preclinical evidence. However, it is therefore important to translate preclinical data into clinical data where the evidence is more limited.",Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,2020.0,11.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '2031505259', 'name': 'Crístofer Ruiz-González'}, {'authorId': '144359248', 'name': 'P.

Their value is increasing as the conduct and publication of research and evaluation has expanded and the process of identifying key insights becomes more time consuming. Text analytics and machine learning (ML) techniques may help overcome this problem of scale while still maintaining the level of rigor expected of SRs. In this article, we discuss an approach that uses existing examples of SRs to build and test a method for assisting the SR title and abstract pre-screening by reducing the initial pool of potential articles down to articles that meet inclusion criteria. Our approach differs from previous approaches to using ML as a SR tool in that it incorporates ML configurations guided by previously conducted SRs, and human confirmation on ML predictions of relevant articles during multiple iterative reviews on smaller tranches of citations. We applied the tailored method to a new SR review effort to validate performance. The case study test of the approach proved a sensitivity (recall) in finding relevant articles during down selection that may rival many traditional processes and show ability to overcome most type II errors. The study achieved a sensitivity of 99.5% (213 out of 214) of total relevant articles while only conducting a human review of 31% of total articles available for review.

We evaluated a machine learning and text mining tool’s ability to (a) automatically extract data elements from randomized trials, and (b) save time compared with manual extraction and verification. For 75 randomized trials, we manually extracted and verified data for 21 data elements. We uploaded the randomized trials to an online machine learning and text mining tool, and quantified performance by evaluating its ability to identify the reporting of data elements (reported or not reported), and the relevance of the extracted sentences, fragments, and overall solutions. For each randomized trial, we measured the time to complete manual extraction and verification, and to review and amend the data extracted by the tool. We calculated the median (interquartile range [IQR]) time for manual and semi-automated data extraction, and overall time savings. The tool identified the reporting (reported or not reported) of data elements with median (IQR) 91% (75% to 99%) accuracy. Among the top five sentences for each data element at least one sentence was relevant in a median (IQR) 88% (83% to 99%) of cases. Among a median (IQR) 90% (86% to 97%) of relevant sentences, pertinent fragments had been highlighted by the tool; exact matches were unreliable (median (IQR) 52% [33% to 73%]). A median 48% of solutions were fully correct, but performance varied greatly across data elements (IQR 21% to 71%). Using ExaCT to assist the first reviewer resulted in a modest time savings compared with manual extraction by a single reviewer (17.9 vs. 21.6 h total extraction time across 75 randomized trials). Using ExaCT to assist with data extraction resulted in modest gains in efficiency compared with manual extraction. The tool was reliable for identifying the reporting of most data elements.

This leads to policy and practice decisions based on out-of-date, incomplete, and biased subsets of available clinical evidence. Extracting and then normalising Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) information from clinical trial articles may be an effective way to automatically assign trials to systematic reviews and avoid searching and screening—the two most time-consuming systematic review processes. We propose and test a novel approach to PICO span detection. The major difference between our proposed method and previous approaches comes from detecting spans without needing annotated span data and using only crowdsourced sentence-level annotations. Experiments on two datasets show that PICO span detection results achieve much higher results for recall when compared to fully supervised methods with PICO sentence detection at least as good as human annotations. By removing the reliance on expert annotations for span detection, this work could be used in a human-machine pipeline for turning low-quality, crowdsourced, and sentence-level PICO annotations into structured information that can be used to quickly assign trials to relevant systematic reviews.",EMNLP,2021.0,1.0,['Computer Science'],"[{'authorId': '1770654', 'name': 'Shifeng Liu'}, {'authorId': '1720826926', 'name': 'Yifang Sun'}, {'authorId': '1399914345', 'name': 'Bing Li'}, {'authorId': '2158505980', 'name': 'Wei Wang'}, {'authorId': '40592816', 'name': 'F.

In this context, the document retrieval and primary study selection steps are heavily intertwined and known for their repetitiveness, high human workload, and difficulty identifying all relevant literature. This study aims to reduce human workload and error of the document retrieval and primary study selection processes using a decision support system (DSS). An open-source DSS is proposed that supports the document retrieval step, dataset preprocessing, and citation classification. The DSS is domain-independent, as it has proven to carefully select an article’s relevance based solely on the title and abstract. These features can be consistently retrieved from scientific database APIs. Additionally, the DSS is designed to run in the cloud without any required programming knowledge for reviewers. A Multi-Channel CNN architecture is implemented to support the citation screening process. With the provided DSS, reviewers can fill in their search strategy and manually label only a subset of the citations. The remaining unlabeled citations are automatically classified and sorted based on probability. It was shown that for four out of five review datasets, the DSS's use achieved significant workload savings of at least 10%. The cross-validation results show that the system provides consistent results up to 88.3% of work saved during citation screening. In two cases, our model yielded a better performance over the benchmark review datasets.

We hypothesized that records could be excluded by a single reviewer without loss of sensitivity in two conditions; the record was ineligible for multiple reasons, or the record was ineligible for one or more specific reasons that could be reliably assessed. Twenty-four SRs performed at CHEO, a pediatric health care and research centre in Ottawa, Canada, were divided into derivation and validation sets. Exclusion criteria during abstract screening were sorted into 11 specific categories, with loss in sensitivity determined by individual category and by number of exclusion criteria endorsed. Five single reviewer algorithms that combined individual categories and multiple exclusion criteria were then tested on the derivation and validation sets, with success defined a priori as less than 5% loss of sensitivity. The 24 SRs included 930 eligible and 27390 ineligible citations. The reviews were mostly focused on pediatrics (70.8%, N=17/24), but covered various specialties. Using a single reviewer to exclude any citation led to an average loss of sensitivity of 8.6% (95%CI, 6.0–12.1%). Excluding citations with ≥2 exclusion criteria led to 1.2% average loss of sensitivity (95%CI, 0.5–3.1%). Five specific exclusion criteria performed with perfect sensitivity: conference abstract, ineligible age group, case report/series, not human research, and review article. In the derivation set, the five algorithms achieved a loss of sensitivity ranging from 0.0 to 1.9% and work-saved ranging from 14.8 to 39.1%. In the validation set, the loss of sensitivity for all 5 algorithms remained below 2.6%, with work-saved between 10.5% and 48.2%. Findings suggest that targeted application of single-reviewer screening, considering both type and number of exclusion criteria, could retain sensitivity and significantly decrease workload.

The screening of titles and abstracts is the most time consuming part of the review process with analysts required review thousands of articles manually, taking on average 33 days. New technologies aimed at streamlining the screening process have provided initial promising findings, yet there are limitations with current approaches and barriers to the widespread use of these tools. In this paper, we introduce and report initial evidence on the utility of Research Screener, a semi-automated machine learning tool to facilitate abstract screening. Three sets of analyses (simulation, interactive and sensitivity) were conducted to provide evidence of the utility of the tool through both simulated and real-world examples. Research Screener delivered a workload saving of between 60 and 96% across nine systematic reviews and two scoping reviews. Findings from the real-world interactive analysis demonstrated a time saving of 12.53 days compared to the manual screening, which equates to a financial saving of USD 2444. Conservatively, our results suggest that analysts who scan 50% of the total pool of articles identified via a systematic search are highly likely to have identified 100% of eligible papers. In light of these findings, Research Screener is able to reduce the burden for researchers wishing to conduct a comprehensive systematic review without reducing the scientific rigour for which they strive to achieve.",Systematic Reviews,2021.0,11.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '1971027', 'name': 'Kevin E.

A well-conducted review enables clinicians and policy-makers to stay updated in their respective fields of interest, and make informed decisions. Once fully automated, it will enable researchers to conduct systematic reviews efficiently, produce high-quality evidence, and contribute more to the field of evidence-based medicine. Mathematical models based on results from swiftly conducted systematic reviews may predict the future incidence or outbreak scenarios for diseases, which are public health problems. Main text: This paper presents an exhaustive literature review on the common methods that can be deployed for automating sub-processes with in a systematic review, their scope, current use, and limitations. A comprehensive search in PubMed and Google Scholar to identify articles or reviews describing use of existing automation tools within the systematic review process was performed. The main methods discussed include machine learning or artificial intelligence, text-mining, and text classification. Current gaps as well as opportunities to improve the quality of a systematic review and the overall evidence generation process are also reviewed. Conclusions: Several technologies like Automatic Term Recognition (ATR), text-mining, text identification, as well as machine learning have already been incorporated to the general process of systematic reviews and so are common tools like Abstrackr, DistillerSR, and RobotAnalyst. The use of automatic classifiers, supervised classification algorithms, and natural language processing has been seen for search of pertinent literature.

Study Design: This descriptive comparative analysis included seven systematic reviews, classified as simple or complex. Two librarians created MEDLINE strategies for each review, using either usual practice (UP) or TMTs. For each search we calculated sensitivity, number-needed-to-read (NNR) and time spent developing the search strategy. Results: We found UP searches were more sensitive (UP 92% (95% CI, 85-99); TMT 84.9% (95% CI, 74.4-95.4)), with lower NNR (UP 83 (SD 34); TMT 90 (SD 68)). UP librarians spent an average of 12 h (SD 8) developing search strategies, compared to TMT librarians’ 5 hours (SD 2). Conclusion: Across all reviews, TMT searches were less sensitive than UP searches, but confidence intervals overlapped. For simple SR topics, TMT searches were faster and slightly less sensitive than UP. For complex SR topics, TMT searches were faster and less sensitive than UP searches but identified unique eligible citations not found by the UP searches.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,2021.0,2.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '46744618', 'name': 'Robin A.

They contribute to carbon lock-in and may hinder a rapid decarbonization of energy systems. Here we provide a systematic map of the literature on carbon lock-in induced by LLCS. Based on a structured search of the Web of Science and Scopus, we identified 226 publications from 38 095 search results using a supervised machine learning approach. We show biases toward power generation and toward developed countries. We also identify 11 indicators used to quantify carbon lock-in. Quantifications of committed emissions (cumulative emissions that would occur over the remaining operational lifetime of an asset) or stranded assets (premature retirement/retrofitting or under-utilization of assets along a given pathway) are the most commonly used metrics, whereas institutional indicators are scarcely represented. The synthesis of quantifications shows that (i) global committed emissions have slightly increased over time, (ii) coal power plants are a major source of committed emissions and are exposed to risk of becoming stranded, (iii) delayed mitigation action increases stranded assets and (iv) sectoral distribution and amount of stranded assets differ between countries. A thematic analysis of policy implications highlights the need to assure stability and legitimacy of climate policies and to enable coordination between stakeholders. Carbon pricing is one of the most cited policy instrument, but the literature emphasizes that it should not be the only instrument used and should instead be complemented with other policy instruments, such as technical regulations and financial support for low carbon capital deployment.

Objective When comparing SR tasks done manually, using standard methods, versus those same SR tasks done using automated tools, (1) what is the difference in time to complete the SR task and (2) what is the impact on the error rate of the SR task? Methods A case study compared specific tasks done during the conduct of an SR on prebiotic, probiotic, and synbiotic supplementation in chronic kidney disease. Two participants (manual team) conducted the SR using current methods, comprising a total of 16 tasks. Another two participants (automation team) conducted the tasks where a systematic review automation (SRA) tool was available, comprising of a total of six tasks. The time taken and error rate of the six tasks that were completed by both teams were compared. Results The approximate time for the manual team to produce a draft of the background, methods, and results sections of the SR was 126 hours. For the six tasks in which times were compared, the manual team spent 2493 minutes (42 hours) on the tasks, compared to 708 minutes (12 hours) spent by the automation team. The manual team had a higher error rate in two of the six tasks—regarding Task 5: Run the systematic search, the manual team made eight errors versus three errors made by the automation team; regarding Task 12: Assess the risk of bias, 25 assessments differed from a reference standard for the manual team compared to 20 differences for the automation team. The manual team had a lower error rate in one of the six tasks—regarding Task 6: Deduplicate search results, the manual team removed one unique study and missed zero duplicates versus the automation team who removed two unique studies and missed seven duplicates. Error rates were similar for the two remaining compared tasks—regarding Task 7: Screen the titles and abstracts and Task 9: Screen the full text, zero relevant studies were excluded by both teams.

We used a set of 27,280 trial registration and article pairs to train and evaluate methods for identifying missing links in both directions—from articles to registrations and from registrations to articles. We trained a classifier with six distance metrics as feature representations to rank the correct article or registration, using recall@K to evaluate performance and compare to baseline methods. When identifying links from registrations to published articles, the classifier ranked the correct article first (recall@1) among 378,048 articles in 80.8% of evaluation cases and 34.9% in the baseline method. Recall@10 was 85.1% compared to 60.7% in the baseline. When predicting links from articles to registrations, recall@1 was 83.4% for the classifier and 39.8% in the baseline. Recall@10 was 89.5% compared to 65.8% in the baseline. The proposed method improves on our baseline document similarity method to be feasible for identifying missing links in practice.

This living systematic review examines published approaches for data extraction from reports of clinical studies. Methods: We systematically and continually search MEDLINE, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), arXiv, and the dblp computer science bibliography databases. Full text screening and data extraction are conducted within an open-source living systematic review application created for the purpose of this review. This iteration of the living review includes publications up to a cut-off date of 22 April 2020. Results: In total, 53 publications are included in this version of our review. Of these, 41 (77%) of the publications addressed extraction of data from abstracts, while 14 (26%) used full texts. A total of 48 (90%) publications developed and evaluated classifiers that used randomised controlled trials as the main target texts. Over 30 entities were extracted, with PICOs (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) being the most frequently extracted. A description of their datasets was provided by 49 publications (94%), but only seven (13%) made the data publicly available. Code was made available by 10 (19%) publications, and five (9%) implemented publicly available tools. Conclusions: This living systematic review presents an overview of (semi)automated data-extraction literature of interest to different types of systematic review. We identified a broad evidence base of publications describing data extraction for interventional reviews and a small number of publications extracting epidemiological or diagnostic accuracy data. The lack of publicly available gold-standard data for evaluation, and lack of application thereof, makes it difficult to draw conclusions on which is the best-performing system for each data extraction target.

Our aim was to describe the process, facilitators, and barriers to completing the first 2-week full SR. Study Design and Setting We systematically reviewed evidence of the impact of increased fluid intake, on urinary tract infection (UTI) recurrence, in individuals at risk for UTIs. The review was conducted by experienced systematic reviewers with complementary skills (two researcher clinicians, an information specialist, and an epidemiologist), using Systematic Review Automation tools, and blocked off time for the duration of the project. The outcomes were time to complete the SR, time to complete individual SR tasks, facilitators and barriers to progress, and peer reviewer feedback on the SR manuscript. Times to completion were analyzed quantitatively (minutes and calendar days); facilitators and barriers were mapped onto the Theoretical Domains Framework; and peer reviewer feedback was analyzed quantitatively and narratively. Results The SR was completed in 61 person-hours (9 workdays; 12 calendar days); accepted version of the manuscript required 71 person-hours. Individual SR tasks ranged from 16 person-minutes (deduplication of search results) to 461 person-minutes (data extraction). The least time-consuming SR tasks were obtaining full-texts, searches, citation analysis, data synthesis, and deduplication. The most time-consuming tasks were data extraction, write-up, abstract screening, full-text screening, and risk of bias. Facilitators and barriers mapped onto the following domains: knowledge; skills; memory, attention, and decision process; environmental context and resources; and technology and infrastructure. Two sets of peer reviewer feedback were received on the manuscript: the first included 34 comments requesting changes, 17 changes were made, requiring 173 person-minutes; the second requested 13 changes, and eight were made, requiring 121 person-minutes. Conclusion A small and experienced systematic reviewer team using Systematic Review Automation tools who have protected time to focus solely on the SR can complete a moderately sized SR in 2 weeks.",,2020.0,58.0,['Computer Science'],"[{'authorId': '35356412', 'name': 'Justin Clark'}, {'authorId': '48429274', 'name': 'P.

 Study-based registers facilitate systematic reviews through shortening the process for review team and reducing considerable waste during the review process. Such a register also provides new insights about trends of trials in a sub-specialty. This paper reports development and content analysis of Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study-Based Register.
 
 
 
 The randomized controlled trials were collected through systematic searches of major information sources. Data points were extracted, curated and classified in the register. We report trends using regression analyses in Microsoft Excel and we used GIS mapping (GunnMap 2) to visualize the geographical distribution of the origin of schizophrenia trials.
 
 
 
 Although only 17% of trials were registered, the number of reports form registered trials is steadily increasing and registered trials produce more reports. Clinical trial registers are main source of trial reports followed by sub-specialty journals. Schizophrenia trials have been published in 23 languages from 90 countries while 105 nations do not have any reported schizophrenia trials. Only 9.7% of trials were included in at least one Cochrane review. Pharmacotherapy is the main target of trials while trials targeting psychotherapy are increasing in a continuous rate. The number of people randomized in trials is on average 114 with 60 being the most frequent sample size.
 
 
 
 Curated datasets within the register uncover new patterns in data that have implications for research, policy, and practice for testing new interventions in trials or systematic reviews.

Systematic reviews allow for data from different studies to be rigorously assessed according to PICO principles (population, intervention, control, outcomes). However, conducting a systematic review is generally a slow process that is a significant drain on resources. The fundamental problem is that the current approach to creating a systematic review cannot scale to meet the challenges resulting from the massive body of unstructured evidence. For this reason, the Public Health Agency of Canada has been examining the automation of different stages of evidence synthesis to increase efficiencies. In this article, we present an overview of an initial version of a novel machine learning–based system that is powered by recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), such as BioBERT, with further optimizations completed using a new immunization-specific document database. The resulting optimized NLP model at the core of this system is able to identify and extract PICO-related fields from publications on immunization with an average accuracy of 88% across five classes of text. Functionality is provided through a straightforward web interface.",Canada Communicable Disease Report,2020.0,1.0,['Computer Science'],"[{'authorId': '14820928', 'name': 'David Begert'}, {'authorId': '2332024', 'name': 'J.

For a convenience sample of 16 reviews for which adequate data were available to address our objectives (11 systematic reviews and 5 rapid reviews), we screened a 200-record training set in Abstrackr and downloaded the relevance (relevant or irrelevant) of the remaining records, as predicted by the tool. We retrospectively simulated the liberal-accelerated screening approach. We estimated the time savings and proportion missed compared with dual independent screening. For reviews with pairwise meta-analyses, we evaluated changes to the pooled effects after removing the missed studies. We explored whether the tool’s predictions varied by review and study-level characteristics. Using the ML-assisted liberal-accelerated approach, we wrongly excluded 0 to 3 (0 to 14%) records that were included in the final reports, but saved a median (IQR) 26 (9, 42) h of screening time. One missed study was included in eight pairwise meta-analyses in one systematic review. The pooled effect for just one of those meta-analyses changed considerably (from MD (95% CI) − 1.53 (− 2.92, − 0.15) to − 1.17 (− 2.70, 0.36)). Of 802 records in the final reports, 87% were correctly predicted as relevant. The correctness of the predictions did not differ by review (systematic or rapid, P = 0.37) or intervention type (simple or complex, P = 0.47). The predictions were more often correct in reviews with multiple (89%) vs. single (83%) research questions (P = 0.01), or that included only trials (95%) vs. multiple designs (86%) (P = 0.003). At the study level, trials (91%), mixed methods (100%), and qualitative (93%) studies were more often correctly predicted as relevant compared with observational studies (79%) or reviews (83%) (P = 0.0006). Studies at high or unclear (88%) vs. low risk of bias (80%) (P = 0.039), and those published more recently (mean (SD) 2008 (7) vs. 2006 (10), P = 0.02) were more often correctly predicted as relevant. Our screening approach saved time and may be suitable in conditions where the limited risk of missing relevant records is acceptable. Several of our findings are paradoxical and require further study to fully understand the tasks to which ML-assisted screening is best suited. The findings should be interpreted in light of the fact that the protocol was prepared for the funder, but not published a priori. Because we used a convenience sample, the findings may be prone to selection bias. The results may not be generalizable to other samples of reviews, ML tools, or screening approaches. The small number of missed studies across reviews with pairwise meta-analyses hindered strong conclusions about the effect of missed studies on the results and conclusions of systematic reviews.",Systematic Reviews,2020.0,5.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '49055691', 'name': 'A.

Published systematic reviews and meta-analyses of environmental and occupational epidemiology studies have increased dramatically in recent years; however, the quality and utility of published reviews are variable. Most methodologies were adapted from clinical epidemiology and have not been adequately modified to evaluate and integrate evidence from observational epidemiology studies assessing environmental and occupational hazards, especially in evaluating the quality of exposure assessments. Although many reviews conduct a systematic and transparent assessment for the potential for bias, they are often deficient in subsequently integrating across a body of evidence. A cohesive review considers the impact of the direction and magnitude of potential biases on the results, systematically evaluates important scientific issues such as study sensitivity and effect modifiers, identifies how different studies complement each other, and assesses other potential sources of heterogeneity.

Summarizing landscape factors and satellite EO data sources, and making the information public are helpful for guiding future research and improving health decision-making. In this case, a review of the literature would appear to be an appropriate tool. However, this is not an easy-to-use tool. The review process mainly includes defining the topic, searching, screening at both title/abstract and full-text levels and data extraction that needs consistent knowledge from experts and is time-consuming and labor intensive. In this context, this study integrates the review process, text scoring, active learning (AL) mechanism, and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks, and proposes a semi-supervised text classification framework that enables the efficient and accurate selection of the relevant articles. Specifically, text scoring and BiLSTM-based active learning were used to replace the title/abstract screening and full-text screening, respectively, which greatly reduces the human workload. In this study, 101 relevant articles were selected from 4 bibliographic databases, and a catalogue of essential dengue landscape factors was identified and divided into four categories: land use (LU), land cover (LC), topography and continuous land surface features. Moreover, various satellite EO sensors and products used for identifying landscape factors were tabulated. Finally, possible future directions of applying satellite EO data in dengue research in terms of landscape patterns, satellite sensors and deep learning were proposed.

 BACKGROUND
 Rapid access to evidence is crucial in times of an evolving clinical crisis. To that end, we propose a novel approach to answer clinical queries, termed rapid meta-analysis (RMA). Unlike traditional meta-analysis, RMA balances a quick time to production with reasonable data quality assurances, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to strike this balance.
 
 
 OBJECTIVE
 We aimed to evaluate whether RMA can generate meaningful clinical insights, but crucially, in a much faster processing time than traditional meta-analysis, using a relevant, real-world example.
 
 
 METHODS
 The development of our RMA approach was motivated by a currently relevant clinical question: is ocular toxicity and vision compromise a side effect of hydroxychloroquine therapy? At the time of designing this study, hydroxychloroquine was a leading candidate in the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We then leveraged AI to pull and screen articles, automatically extract their results, review the studies, and analyze the data with standard statistical methods.
 
 
 RESULTS
 By combining AI with human analysis in our RMA, we generated a meaningful, clinical result in less than 30 minutes. The RMA identified 11 studies considering ocular toxicity as a side effect of hydroxychloroquine and estimated the incidence to be 3.4% (95% CI 1.11%-9.96%). The heterogeneity across individual study findings was high, which should be taken into account in interpretation of the result.
 
 
 CONCLUSIONS
 We demonstrate that a novel approach to meta-analysis using AI can generate meaningful clinical insights in a much shorter time period than traditional meta-analysis.

 Background: Parents can be psychologically impacted when children have eye diseases such as blindness, strabismus, and eye cancer. Stress can reduce the quality of parental care, and may be linked to the deterioration of parents’ and children’s mental and physical health, and family dynamics. No systematic literature review on parental stress in ophthalmology has been found to provide evidence synthesis capable of stimulating and defining new studies promoting research in this field. To address this important gap, the present review aims to synthesize evidence about approaches, methods, instruments, and results from research regarding ophthalmology-related parental stress. Methods: Primary epidemiological observational studies should be original in addressing parental stress caused by ophthalmological health conditions in children. Children must be up to 12 years old and should not have any other associated chronic/disabling condition. Studies must present a summary, and full text should be available in a database. They should present an instrument for assessing parental stress and characterizing the study population. MEDLINE (via Ovid), EMBASE, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and Gray Literature (PsycEXTRA, NTIS and OpenSINGLE) will be searched. Controlled vocabulary, Boolean operators, and defined search strategies will be used. There will be no restrictions on the studies’ publication language, which will be selected in two screening stages. Two reviewers will independently retrieve full-text studies, assess methodological quality, and extract data. Data available through December 2020 will be considered for inclusion. Discussion: The socioeconomic characterization of the participants, the identification of which ophthalmological diseases have been studied in relation to parental stress, and the knowledge of each instrument and methodology peculiarities potentially contribute to this study. The results may promote the development or enhancement of public policies focused on this specific theme, thereby providing the means for potential improvement of physical and mental health for parents and children with eye diseases.Systematic review registration: The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO: number CRD42018094972.",,2020.0,0.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '1417053893', 'name': 'Julio Cesar Souza-Silva'}, {'authorId': '2092245201', 'name': 'Cleusa Alves Martins'}, {'authorId': '2092321306', 'name': 'M.

Evidence-based women's healthcare is underpinned by systematic reviews and guidelines. Generating an evidence synthesis to support guidance for clinical practice is a time-consuming and labour-intensive activity that delays transfer of research into practice. Artificial intelligence has the potential to rapidly collate, combine, and update high-quality medical evidence with accuracy and precision, and without bias.


RECENT FINDINGS
This article describes the main fields of artificial intelligence with examples of its application to systematic reviews. These include the capabilities of processing natural language texts, retrieving information, reasoning, and learning. The complementarity and interconnection of the various artificial intelligence techniques can be harnessed to solve difficult problems in automation of reviews. Computer science can advance evidence-based medicine through development, testing, and refinement of artificial intelligence tools to deploy automation, creating 'living' evidence syntheses.


SUMMARY
Groundbreaking, high-quality, and impactful artificial intelligence will accelerate the transfer of individual research studies seamlessly into evidence syntheses for contemporaneously improving the quality of healthcare.",Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,2020.0,2.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '101852524', 'name': 'C.

Although TA-mediated increases in FFM may enhance physical performance, the data are largely equivocal, which may be due to differences in study populations, the magnitude of change in serum T and FFM, or the performance metrics. This meta-analysis explored effects of TA on serum T, FFM, and performance. Associations between increases in serum T and FFM were assessed, and whether changes in serum T or FFM, study population, or the performance metrics affected performance was determined. A systematic review of double-blind randomized trials comparing TA versus placebo on serum T, FFM, and performance was performed. Data were extracted from 20 manuscripts. Effect sizes (ESs) were assessed using Hedge's g and a random effects model. Data are presented as ES (95% confidence interval). No significant correlation between changes in serum T and FFM was observed (P = .167). Greater increases in serum T, but not FFM, resulted in larger effects on performance. Larger increases in testosterone (7.26 [0.76-13.75]) and FFM (0.80 [0.20-1.41]) were observed in young males, but performance only improved in diseased (0.16 [0.05-0.28]) and older males (0.19 [0.10-0.29]). TA increased lower body (0.12 [0.07-0.18]), upper body (0.26 [0.11-0.40]), and handgrip (0.13 [0.04-0.22]) strength, lower body muscular endurance (0.38 [0.09-0.68]), and functional performance (0.20 [0.00-0.41]), but not lower body power or aerobic endurance. TA elicits increases in serum T and FFM in younger, older, and diseased males; however, the performance-enhancing effects of TA across studies were small, observed mostly in muscular strength and endurance, and only in older and diseased males.",Journal of the Endocrine Society,2020.0,2.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '5085378', 'name': 'Alyssa N.

In those cases where the search topic is difficult to establish or has fuzzy limits, researchers require to broaden the scope of the search and, in consequence, data from retrieved scientific publications may become huge and uncorrelated. However, through a convenient analysis of these data the researcher may be able to discover new knowledge which may be hidden within the search output, thus exploring the limits of the search and enhancing the review scope. With that aim, this paper presents an iterative methodology that applies text mining and machine learning techniques to a downloaded corpus of abstracts from scientific databases, combining automatic processing algorithms with tools for supervised decision-making in an iterative process sustained on the researchers’ judgement, so as to adapt, screen and tune the search output.

We developed a rule‐based approach to automatically extract information from reviews and updates to be used as features for modelling conclusion change risk. Rules were developed to extract relevant information from published Cochrane reviews and used to construct four features: the number of included trials and participants in the reviews, a measure based on the number of participants, and the time elapsed between the search dates. We compared the performance of random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression to predict the conclusion change risk. The performance was measured by accuracy, precision, recall, F1‐score, and area under ROC (AU‐ROC). One rule was developed to extract the conclusion change information (96% accuracy, 100 reviews), one for the search date (100% accuracy, 100 reviews), one for the number of included clinical trials (100% accuracy, 100 reviews), and 22 for the number of participants (97.3% accuracy, 200 reviews). For unseen reviews, the random forest classifier showed the highest accuracy (80.8%) and AU‐ROC (0.80). All classifiers showed relatively similar performance with overlapping 95% confidence interval (CI). The coverage score was shown to be the most useful feature for predicting the conclusion change risk. Features mined from Cochrane reviews and updates can estimate conclusion change risk. If data from more published reviews and updates were made accessible, data‐driven methods to predict the conclusion change risk may be a feasible way to support decisions about updating reviews.",Research synthesis methods,2020.0,0.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '10280969', 'name': 'R.

A typical review may require screening thousands or tens of thousands of articles in and can utilize hundreds of person-hours of labor. Methods Here we introduce SWIFT-Active Screener, a web-based, collaborative systematic review software application, designed to reduce the overall screening burden required during this resource-intensive phase of the review process. To prioritize articles for review, SWIFT-Active Screener uses active learning, a type of machine learning that incorporates user feedback during screening. Meanwhile, a negative binomial model is employed to estimate the number of relevant articles remaining in the unscreened document list. Using a simulation involving 26 diverse systematic review datasets that were previously screened by reviewers, we evaluated both the document prioritization and recall estimation methods. Results On average, 95% of the relevant articles were identified after screening only 40% of the total reference list. In the 5 document sets with 5,000 or more references, 95% recall was achieved after screening only 34% of the available references, on average. Furthermore, the recall estimator we have proposed provides a useful, conservative estimate of the percentage of relevant documents identified during the screening process. Conclusion SWIFT-Active Screener can result in significant time savings compared to traditional screening and the savings are increased for larger project sizes. Moreover, the integration of explicit recall estimation during screening solves an important challenge faced by all machine learning systems for document screening: when to stop screening a prioritized reference list. The software is currently available in the form of a multi-user, collaborative, online web application.",Environment international,2020.0,29.0,"['Medicine', 'Computer Science']","[{'authorId': '39828861', 'name': 'Brian E.

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of physical activity interventions as an alternative or complementary treatment for adolescents (12–18 years) with depression. The characteristics of the physical activity treatment that were most effective in reducing symptoms in adolescents with depression and the impact of methodological shortcomings in the existing research were also examined. Methods: Medline, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, ProQuest, and CENTRAL were searched for eligible records. Effect size estimates were pooled based on the application of a random-effects model. Potential moderation by physical activity characteristics (i.e., intensity, type, context, and time frame) and methodological features (i.e., type of control group and diagnostic tool to identify depression at baseline) was investigated by means of subgroup analyses and meta-regressions. The certainty of evidence was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The primary outcome was the antidepressant effect of physical activity at postintervention measurement time point. As secondary outcomes, the sustainability of effects after the end of physical activity treatment and the acceptability of physical activity treatments were assessed. Overall, 10 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis and 9 studies involving 431 patients were included in the quantitative synthesis. Results: A moderate, significant antidepressant effect of physical activity was found (Hedges' g = −0.47, 95% CI = −0.71 to −0.24). Heterogeneity was small (T2 = 0.0313, I2 = 27%, p = 0.18). However, the certainty of evidence was downgraded to low because the included studies contained serious methodological limitations. Moderator analyses revealed that session intensity significantly moderated the antidepressant effect of physical activity. Moreover, noticeably smaller effect sizes were found in studies that used non-physical activity sham treatments as control treatments (e.g., playing board games), compared to studies that used no control group treatments. Only three studies assessed the sustainability of effects after the end of physical activity treatment. The results suggest that the antidepressant effects further increase after the end of physical activity interventions. There was no significant difference in dropout risk between the physical activity and control groups. Conclusions: This review suggests that physical activity is effective in treating depression in adolescents. Physical activity sessions should be at least moderately intense [rate of perceived exertion (RPE) between 11 and 13] to be effective. Furthermore, our results suggest that physical activity treatments are well accepted. However, the low methodological quality in included studies might have led to effect overestimation. Therefore, more studies with higher methodological quality are needed to confirm the recommendation for physical activity treatments in adolescents with depression.",Frontiers in Physiology,2020.0,21.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '145587370', 'name': 'M.

The effect of a specific medication on osseointegration can be easily investigated using traditional systematic reviews. However, assessment of all known medications requires the use of evidence mapping methods. These methods allow assessment of complex questions, but they are very resource intensive when done manually. The objective of this study was to develop a machine learning algorithm to automatically map the literature assessing the effect of medications on osseointegration. Datasets of articles classified manually were used to train a machine-learning algorithm based on Support Vector Machines. The algorithm was then validated and used to screen 599,604 articles identified with an extremely sensitive search strategy. The algorithm included 281 relevant articles that described the effect of 31 different drugs on osseointegration. This approach achieved an accuracy of 95%, and compared to manual screening, it reduced the workload by 93%. The systematic mapping revealed that the treatment outcomes of osseointegrated medical devices could be influenced by drugs affecting homeostasis, inflammation, cell proliferation and bone remodeling.

The goal of this chapter is to provide an overview of strategies researchers have developed to automate the SLR process. We used a systematic search methodology to survey the literature about the strategies used to automate the SLR process in SE. Study selection is the most supported activity, while protocol definition, data extraction, and synthesis have only partial support. SE researchers have most frequently explored the visual text mining strategy.

While these diets enhance fat and reduce carbohydrate oxidation during exercise, the impact of a KD on physical performance remains controversial. The objective of this work was to assess the effect of KDs on physical performance compared with mixed macronutrient diets [control (CON)]. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed and Cochrane Library databases. Randomized and nonrandomized studies were included if participants were healthy (free of chronic disease), nonobese [BMI (kg/m2) <30], trained or untrained men or women consuming KD (<50 g carbohydrate/d or serum or whole-blood β-hydroxybutyrate >0.5 mmol/L) compared with CON (fat, 12-38% of total energy intake) diets for ≥14 d, followed by a physical performance test. Seventeen studies (10 parallel, 7 crossover) with 29 performance (13 endurance, 16 power or strength) outcomes were identified. Of the 13 endurance-type performance outcomes, 3 (1 time trial, 2 time-to-exhaustion) reported lower and 10 (4 time trials, 6 time-to-exhaustion) reported no difference in performance between the KD compared with CON. Of the 16 power or strength performance outcomes, 3 (1 power, 2 strength) reported lower, 11 (4 power, 7 strength) no difference, and 2 (power) enhanced performance in the KD compared with the CON. Risk of bias identified some concern of bias primarily due to studies allowing participants to self-select diet intervention groups and the inability to blind participants to the study intervention. Overall, the majority of null results across studies suggest that a KD does not have a positive or negative impact on physical performance compared with a CON diet. However, discordant results between studies may be due to multiple factors, such as the duration consuming study diets, training status, performance test, and sex differences, which will be discussed in this systematic review.",Advances in nutrition,2020.0,9.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '4737131', 'name': 'Nancy E.

Automating them is elusive due to subtlety of concepts and complexity of interrelationships implicit in text semantics. However, when assessing topics relating to current trends, these factors are less important as there is inherent breadth and diversity in the text which countermands the need for expertise. This paper presents an approach for trend topic analysis using simple bibliometrics of Term Frequency and Keyword Selection, extracted with natural language processing tools NLTK and AntConc. This approach is applied to a case study of identifying trends in Telemedicine research in South Africa based on 2019 publications included in PubMed.

In this context, expert searchers construct lengthy Boolean queries. The universe of possible query variations can be massive: a single query can be composed of hundreds of field-restricted search terms/phrases or ontological concepts, each grouped by a logical operator nested to depths of sometimes five or more levels deep. With the many choices about how to construct a query, it is difficult to both formulate and recognise effective queries. To address this challenge, automatic methods have recently been explored for generating and selecting effective Boolean query variations for systematic reviews. The limiting factor of these methods is that it is computationally infeasible to process all query variations for training the methods. To overcome this, we propose novel query variation sampling methods for training Learning to Rank models to rank queries. Our results show that query sampling methods do directly impact the ability of a Learning to Rank model to effectively identify good query variations. Thus, selecting appropriate query sampling methods is a key problem for the automatic reformulation of effective Boolean queries for systematic review literature search.

The typical process of constructing search strategies is often undocumented, ad-hoc, and subject to individual expertise, which may introduce bias in the systematic review. A new method for objectively deriving search strategies has arisen from information specialists attempting to address these shortcomings. However, this proposed method still presents a number of manual, ad-hoc interventions, and trial-and-error processes, potentially still introducing bias into systematic reviews. Moreover, this method has not been rigorously evaluated on a large set of systematic review cases, thus its generalisability is unknown. In this work, we present a computational adaptation of this proposed objective method. Our adaptation removes the human-in-the-loop processes involved in the initial steps of creating a search strategy for a systematic review; reducing bias due to human factors and increasing the objectivity of the originally proposed method.

Keeping up to date with the latest medical information using Web-based resources has been sparsely described, and a comprehensive up-to-date review is needed.


OBJECTIVES
To summarise the Web-based 'channels' that may assist the actors of the health care system (clinicians, medical researchers and students) to keep up to date with medical information.


METHODS
We searched PubMed and Scopus for English language articles published between January 1990 and February 2019 that investigated ways for keeping up with medical information. We used the results from our search and relevant information from other sources to conduct a narrative synthesis.


RESULTS
We found that resources that push information (e.g. web alerts, medical newsletters, listservs), resources that rely on the active information seeking (e.g. access to health librarians and electronic databases, podcasts, mobile apps), collaborative resources (e.g. web conferences, online journal clubs, web social media) and resources that synthesise information (e.g. bibliometrics, living systematic reviews) can contribute in keeping up with new findings and can enhance evidence-based medicine. Clinicians, medical researchers and students can benefit from the proper use of such Internet-based technological innovations.


CONCLUSION
Internet provides many resources that can help the actors of the health care system stay up to date with the latest scientific findings.",Health information and libraries journal,2020.0,10.0,"['Medicine', 'Computer Science']","[{'authorId': '27000929', 'name': 'K.

What it means to appropriately synthesize research, however, remains a matter of debate: Syntheses can assume a variety of forms, each with important implications for the shape knowledge takes and the interests it serves. To help shed light on these differences and their stakes, this chapter provides a critical comparative review of six research synthesis infrastructures, entities that support research syntheses through investments they make in synthesis production and/or publication—enabling (and constraining) the ways knowledge takes shape. Identifying our critical cases through purposive selection, we examined research synthesis infrastructure variations with respect to four different kinds of investments they make: in the genres of synthesis they support, in their promotion of synthesis quality, in sponsoring stakeholder engagement, and in creating the conditions for collective work.

 BACKGROUND
 Systematic reviews (SRs) are considered the highest level of evidence to answer research questions; however, they are time and resource intensive.
 
 
 OBJECTIVE
 When comparing SR tasks done manually, using standard methods, versus those same SR tasks done using automated tools, (1) what is the difference in time to complete the SR task and (2) what is the impact on the error rate of the SR task?
 
 
 METHODS
 A case study compared specific tasks done during the conduct of an SR on prebiotic, probiotic, and synbiotic supplementation in chronic kidney disease. Two participants (manual team) conducted the SR using current methods, comprising a total of 16 tasks. Another two participants (automation team) conducted the tasks where a systematic review automation (SRA) tool was available, comprising of a total of six tasks. The time taken and error rate of the six tasks that were completed by both teams were compared.
 
 
 RESULTS
 The approximate time for the manual team to produce a draft of the background, methods, and results sections of the SR was 126 hours. For the six tasks in which times were compared, the manual team spent 2493 minutes (42 hours) on the tasks, compared to 708 minutes (12 hours) spent by the automation team. The manual team had a higher error rate in two of the six tasks—regarding Task 5: Run the systematic search, the manual team made eight errors versus three errors made by the automation team; regarding Task 12: Assess the risk of bias, 25 assessments differed from a reference standard for the manual team compared to 20 differences for the automation team. The manual team had a lower error rate in one of the six tasks—regarding Task 6: Deduplicate search results, the manual team removed one unique study and missed zero duplicates versus the automation team who removed two unique studies and missed seven duplicates. Error rates were similar for the two remaining compared tasks—regarding Task 7: Screen the titles and abstracts and Task 9: Screen the full text, zero relevant studies were excluded by both teams. One task could not be compared between groups—Task 8: Find the full text.
 
 
 CONCLUSIONS
 For the majority of SR tasks where an SRA tool was used, the time required to complete that task was reduced for novice researchers while methodological quality was maintained.

We examined whether objective methods, originally developed to identify systematic reviews, could be applied to a multidisciplinary topic, alcohol-impaired driving (AID). We performed word-frequency analyses of titles/abstracts/keywords on citations randomly selected from a ‘gold standard’ database of 131 controlled studies evaluating AID interventions. Identified words were tested in the Web of Science databases for sensitivity, precision, and feasibility. Words meeting varying sensitivity and precision thresholds were combined into search strategies. All threshold combinations with cumulative sensitivity of at least 75% retrieved ≥ 100,000 citations. The word frequency-based procedure was therefore modified, first by eliminating non-specific words, then by categorizing and combining the remaining words. With these modifications, sensitivity was 80.0% and precision 4.4%, retrieving 17,565 citations. Against a validation set, sensitivity was 85.7% and precision 3.5%. To identify studies on multidisciplinary topics, objective methods may be useful initially but may need to be modified to meet sensitivity and feasibility targets.",J. Inf.

This study demonstrates the use of an economic evaluation framework to compare the costs and effects of four variant approaches to identifying eligible studies for consideration in systematic reviews. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a basic decision-analytic model, to compare the relative efficiency of ‘safety first’, ‘double screening’, ‘single screening’ and ‘single screening with text mining’ approaches in the title-abstract screening stage of a ‘case study’ systematic review about undergraduate medical education in UK general practice settings. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the ‘incremental cost per citation ‘saved’ from inappropriate exclusion’ from the review. Resource use and effect parameters were estimated based on retrospective analysis of ‘review process’ meta-data curated alongside the ‘case study’ review, in conjunction with retrospective simulation studies to model the integrated use of text mining. Unit cost parameters were estimated based on the ‘case study’ review’s project budget. A base case analysis was conducted, with deterministic sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact of variations in values of key parameters. Use of ‘single screening with text mining’ would have resulted in title-abstract screening workload reductions (base case analysis) of >60 % compared with other approaches. Across modelled scenarios, the ‘safety first’ approach was, consistently, equally effective and less costly than conventional ‘double screening’. Compared with ‘single screening with text mining’, estimated ICERs for the two non-dominated approaches (base case analyses) ranged from £1975 (‘single screening’ without a ‘provisionally included’ code) to £4427 (‘safety first’ with a ‘provisionally included’ code) per citation ‘saved’. Patterns of results were consistent between base case and sensitivity analyses. Alternatives to the conventional ‘double screening’ approach, integrating text mining, warrant further consideration as potentially more efficient approaches to identifying eligible studies for systematic reviews. Comparable economic evaluations conducted using other systematic review datasets are needed to determine the generalisability of these findings and to build an evidence base to inform guidance for review authors.",Systematic Reviews,2016.0,78.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '4736381', 'name': 'I.

Text mining has been offered as a potential solution: through automating some of the screening process, reviewer time can be saved. The evidence base around the use of text mining for screening has not yet been pulled together systematically; this systematic review fills that research gap. Focusing mainly on non-technical issues, the review aims to increase awareness of the potential of these technologies and promote further collaborative research between the computer science and systematic review communities. Five research questions led our review: what is the state of the evidence base; how has workload reduction been evaluated; what are the purposes of semi-automation and how effective are they; how have key contextual problems of applying text mining to the systematic review field been addressed; and what challenges to implementation have emerged? We answered these questions using standard systematic review methods: systematic and exhaustive searching, quality-assured data extraction and a narrative synthesis to synthesise findings. The evidence base is active and diverse; there is almost no replication between studies or collaboration between research teams and, whilst it is difficult to establish any overall conclusions about best approaches, it is clear that efficiencies and reductions in workload are potentially achievable. On the whole, most suggested that a saving in workload of between 30% and 70% might be possible, though sometimes the saving in workload is accompanied by the loss of 5% of relevant studies (i.e. a 95% recall). Using text mining to prioritise the order in which items are screened should be considered safe and ready for use in ‘live’ reviews. The use of text mining as a ‘second screener’ may also be used cautiously. The use of text mining to eliminate studies automatically should be considered promising, but not yet fully proven. In highly technical/clinical areas, it may be used with a high degree of confidence; but more developmental and evaluative work is needed in other disciplines.",Systematic Reviews,2015.0,398.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '1398268605', 'name': ""A.

Our objective was to develop a validated search strategy to retrieve overviews in MEDLINE. Study Design and Setting We derived a test set of overviews from the references of two method articles on overviews. Two population sets were used to identify discriminating terms, that is, terms that appear frequently in the test set but infrequently in two population sets of references found in MEDLINE. We used text mining to conduct a frequency analysis of terms appearing in the titles and abstracts. Candidate terms were combined and tested in MEDLINE in various permutations, and the performance of strategies measured using sensitivity and precision. Results Two search strategies were developed: a sensitivity-maximizing strategy, achieving 93% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI]: 87, 96) and 7% precision (95% CI: 6, 8), and a sensitivity-and-precision–maximizing strategy, achieving 66% sensitivity (95% CI: 58, 74) and 21% precision (95% CI: 17, 25).

They may also facilitate access to PubMed’s unique content, including citations for the most recently published biomedical evidence. Retrieving this content requires a search strategy comprising natural language terms (‘textwords’), rather than Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). We describe a reproducible methodology that uses a validated PubMed search filter translation to create a textword-only strategy to extend retrieval to PubMed’s unique heart failure literature. We translated an OvidSP Medline heart failure search filter for PubMed and established version equivalence in terms of indexed literature retrieval. The PubMed version was then run within PubMed to identify citations retrieved by the filter’s MeSH terms (Heart failure, Left ventricular dysfunction, and Cardiomyopathy). It was then rerun with the same MeSH terms restricted to searching on title and abstract fields (i.e. as ‘textwords’). Citations retrieved by the MeSH search but not the textword search were isolated. Frequency analysis of their titles/abstracts identified natural language alternatives for those MeSH terms that performed less effectively as textwords. These terms were tested in combination to determine the best performing search string for reclaiming this ‘lost set’. This string, restricted to searching on PubMed’s unique content, was then combined with the validated PubMed translation to extend the filter’s performance in this database. The PubMed heart failure filter retrieved 6829 citations. Of these, 834 (12%) failed to be retrieved when MeSH terms were converted to textwords. Frequency analysis of the 834 citations identified five high frequency natural language alternatives that could improve retrieval of this set (cardiac failure, cardiac resynchronization, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and LV dysfunction). Together these terms reclaimed 157/834 (18.8%) of lost citations. MeSH terms facilitate precise searching in PubMed’s indexed subset. They may, however, work less effectively as search terms prior to subject indexing. A validated PubMed search filter can be used to develop a supplementary textword-only search strategy to extend retrieval to PubMed’s unique content.

However, it can be difficult for researchers to explore and search such large volumes of data in an efficient manner. Text mining (TM) methods can help, through their ability to recognise various types of semantic information automatically, e.g., instances of concepts (places, medical conditions, drugs, etc.), synonyms/variant forms of concepts, and relationships holding between concepts (which drugs are used to treat which medical conditions, etc.). TM analysis allows search systems to incorporate functionality such as automatic suggestions of synonyms of user-entered query terms, exploration of different concepts mentioned within search results or isolation of documents in which concepts are related in specific ways. However, applying TM methods to historical text can be challenging, according to differences and evolutions in vocabulary, terminology, language structure and style, compared to more modern text. In this article, we present our efforts to overcome the various challenges faced in the semantic analysis of published historical medical text dating back to the mid 19th century. Firstly, we used evidence from diverse historical medical documents from different periods to develop new resources that provide accounts of the multiple, evolving ways in which concepts, their variants and relationships amongst them may be expressed. These resources were employed to support the development of a modular processing pipeline of TM tools for the robust detection of semantic information in historical medical documents with varying characteristics. We applied the pipeline to two large-scale medical document archives covering wide temporal ranges as the basis for the development of a publicly accessible semantically-oriented search system. The novel resources are available for research purposes, while the processing pipeline and its modules may be used and configured within the Argo TM platform.",PloS one,2016.0,43.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '145363213', 'name': 'Paul Thompson'}, {'authorId': '1400900759', 'name': 'R.

Methods Two different MEDLINE search strategies were developed in parallel for five systematic reviews covering a range of topics and study designs. The Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) applied an objective approach, and external experts applied a conceptual approach for the same research questions. For each systematic review, the citations retrieved were combined and the overall pool of citations screened to determine sensitivity and precision. Results The objective approach yielded a weighted mean sensitivity and precision of 97% and 5%. The corresponding values for the conceptual approach were 75% and 4%. Conclusion Our findings indicate that the objective approach applied by IQWiG for search strategy development yields higher sensitivity than and similar precision to a conceptual approach. The main advantage of the objective approach is that it produces consistent results across searches.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,2016.0,26.0,"['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '6498890', 'name': 'Elke Hausner'}, {'authorId': '4248401', 'name': 'C.

The objective approach draws on already established text analysis methods for developing search filters. Our aim was to determine whether the objective approach for the development of search strategies was noninferior to the conceptual approach commonly used in Cochrane reviews (CRs). Methods We conducted a search for CRs published in the Cochrane Library. The studies included in the CRs were searched for in MEDLINE and represented the total set. We then tested whether references previously removed could be identified via the objective approach. We also reconstructed the original search strategies from the CRs to determine why references could not be identified by the objective approach. As we performed the validation of the search strategies without study filters, we used only sensitivity as a quality measure and did not calculate precision. Results The objective approach yielded a mean sensitivity of 96% based on 13 searches. The noninferiority test showed that this approach was noninferior to the conceptual approach used in the CRs ( P Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, our findings indicate for the first time that the objective approach for the development of search strategies is noninferior to the conceptual approach.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,2015.0,40.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '6498890', 'name': 'Elke Hausner'}, {'authorId': '4248401', 'name': 'C.

Healthcare debates and policy developments are increasingly concerned with a broad range of values-related areas. These include not only ethical, moral, religious, and other types of values 'proper', but also beliefs, preferences, experiences, choices, satisfaction, quality of life, etc. Research on such issues may be difficult to retrieve. This study used word frequency analysis to generate a broad pool of search terms and a brief filter to facilitate relevant searches in bibliographic databases.


METHODS
Word frequency analysis for 'values terms' was performed on citations on diabetes, obesity, dementia, and schizophrenia (Medline; 2004-2006; 4440 citations; 1,110,291 words). Concordance® and SPSS 14.0 were used. Text words and MeSH terms of high frequency and precision were compiled into a search filter. It was validated on datasets of citations on dentistry and food hypersensitivity.


RESULTS
144 unique text words and 124 unique MeSH terms of moderate and high frequency (≥ 20) and very high precision (≥ 90%) were identified. Of these, 19 text words and seven MeSH terms were compiled into a 'brief values filter'. In the derivation dataset, it had a sensitivity of 76.8% and precision of 86.8%. In the validation datasets, its sensitivity and precision were, respectively, 70.1% and 63.6% (food hypersensitivity) and 47.1% and 82.6% (dentistry).


CONCLUSIONS
This study provided a varied pool of search terms and a simple and highly effective tool for retrieving publications on health-related values.

In particular, search filters have been designed to help health-care professionals identify systematic reviews of the effectiveness of health interventions. Identifying systematic reviews in databases such as MEDLINE is problematic and research has previously been undertaken into methods to design search filters that retrieve systematic reviews effectively. The aim of this study was to improve previously developed methods to derive a more objective search strategy to identify systematic reviews in MEDLINE. A ‘quasi-gold standard’ collection of known systematic reviews was identified. A frequency analysis of words within a subset of the ‘quasi-gold standard’ was undertaken followed by a statistical analysis of the most frequently occurring words. This analysis determined which terms would best distinguish between systematic reviews, non-systematic reviews and non-reviews. The performance of the best models was tested on the remaining subset of ‘quasi-gold standard’ records and then using the OVID interface to MEDLINE. The best model had a sensitivity of 73.4% for systematic reviews in the test set and 84.2% when used with the validation set. The best model had a specificity of 98.3% in the test set and 93% in the validation set. When tested on the same ‘quasi-gold standard’ using OVID MED-LINE the model showed 100% sensitivity and 4.4% precision. The number of times a term occurs in a record adds discriminatory power to the search strategy. Apparently highly relevant terms chosen subjectively do not perform as well as those derived by a statistical approach. Some search terms may not immediately seem useful in identifying systematic reviews, but when used in combination with other terms they prove to be highly discriminating. The best performing filters were tested on the OVID interface, but without frequency and term weightings. Their performance was also compared to previously published filters. One of the strategies was found to perform better with respect to sensitivity than previously published filters, although with lower precision.",J. Inf.

This task becomes even more difficult if the field of interest involves the use of diverse methods and data sources, as is the case with staffing research. This type of research investigates the association between staffing parameters and nursing and patient outcomes. A comprehensively developed search strategy may help identify staffing research in PubMed/Medline. A set of relevant references in PubMed/Medline was identified by means of three systematic reviews. This development set was used to detect candidate free-text and MeSH terms. The frequency of these terms was compared to a random sample from PubMed/Medline in order to identify terms specific to staffing research, which were then used to develop a sensitive, precise and balanced search strategy. To determine their precision, the newly developed search strategies were tested against a) the pool of relevant references extracted from the systematic reviews, b) a reference set identified from an electronic journal screening, and c) a sample from PubMed/Medline. Finally, all newly developed strategies were compared to PubMed's Health Services Research Queries (PubMed's HSR Queries). The sensitivities of the newly developed search strategies were almost 100% in all of the three test sets applied; precision ranged from 6.1% to 32.0%. PubMed's HSR queries were less sensitive (83.3% to 88.2%) than the new search strategies. Only minor differences in precision were found (5.0% to 32.0%). As with other literature on health services research, staffing studies are difficult to identify in PubMed/Medline. Depending on the purpose of the search, researchers can choose between high sensitivity and retrieval of a large number of references or high precision, i.e. and an increased risk of missing relevant references, respectively. More standardized terminology (e.g. by consistent use of the term nurse staffing) could improve the precision of future searches in this field. Empirically selected search terms can help to develop effective search strategies. The high consistency between all test sets confirmed the validity of our approach.",BMC medical research methodology,2010.0,15.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '40475788', 'name': 'M.

Specifically, we sought to identify evidence on community engagement in public health interventions that aim to reduce health inequalities. Our initial search strategy used text mining to identify synonyms for the concept ‘community engagement’. We conducted a systematic search for reviews on public health interventions, supplemented by searches of trials databases. We then used information in the reviews' evidence tables to gather more information about the included studies than was evident in the primary studies' own titles or abstracts. We identified 319 primary studies cited in reviews after full‐text screening. In this paper, we retrospectively reflect on the challenges and benefits of the approach taken. We estimate that more than a quarter of the studies that were identified would have been missed by typical searching and screening methods. This identification strategy was highly effective and could be useful for reviews of broad research questions, or where the key concepts are unlikely to be the main focus of primary research.

Despite this privilege, keeping up with primary research evidence is almost impossible because of the increase in professional publishing across disciplines. Systematic reviews are a solution to this problem as they aim to synthesize all current information on a particular topic and present a balanced and unbiased summary of the findings. They are fast becoming an important method of research across a number of fields, yet only a small number of guidelines exist on how to define and select terms for a systematic search. This article presents a replicable method for selecting terms in a systematic search using the semantic concept recognition software called leximancer (Leximancer, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia). We use this software to construct a set of terms from a corpus of literature pertaining to transborder interventions for drug control and discuss the applicability of this method to systematic reviews in general. This method aims to contribute a more ‘systematic’ approach for selecting terms in a manner that is entirely replicable for any user.

225,cd7c88ccecf28a117f4cfd1647a37d155a1f3ce3,Routine development of objectively derived search strategies,"Over the past few years, information retrieval has become more and more professionalized, and information specialists are considered full members of a research team conducting systematic reviews. Research groups preparing systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines have been the driving force in the development of search strategies, but open questions remain regarding the transparency of the development process and the available resources. An empirically guided approach to the development of a search strategy provides a way to increase transparency and efficiency. Our aim in this paper is to describe the empirically guided development process for search strategies as applied by the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (Institut fur Qualitat und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen, or IQWiG). This strategy consists of the following steps: generation of a test set, as well as the development, validation and standardized documentation of the search strategy. We illustrate our approach by means of an example, that is, a search for literature on brachytherapy in patients with prostate cancer. For this purpose, a test set was generated, including a total of 38 references from 3 systematic reviews. The development set for the generation of the strategy included 25 references. After application of textual analytic procedures, a strategy was developed that included all references in the development set. To test the search strategy on an independent set of references, the remaining 13 references in the test set (the validation set) were used. The validation set was also completely identified. Our conclusion is that an objectively derived approach similar to that used in search filter development is a feasible way to develop and validate reliable search strategies. Besides creating high-quality strategies, the widespread application of this approach will result in a substantial increase in the transparency of the development process of search strategies.",Systematic Reviews,2012.0,64.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '6498890', 'name': 'Elke Hausner'}, {'authorId': '46882750', 'name': 'S.

To facilitate this, we aimed to develop and evaluate a comprehensive and efficient search strategy in PubMed, to be used by either researchers or practitioners and that will identify articles on the prognosis of work disability. Methods We used a diagnostic test analytic framework. First, we created a reference set of 225 articles on the prognosis of work disability by screening a total of 65 692 titles and abstracts from10 journals in the period 2000–2009. Included studies had a minimum follow-up of 6 months, participants in the age of 18–64 with a minimum sick leave of 4 weeks or longer or having serious activity limitations in 50% of the cases and outcome measures that reflect impairments, activity limitations or participation restrictions. Using text mining methods, we extracted search terms from the reference set and, according to sensitivity and relative frequency, we combined these into search strings. Results Both the research and the practice search filter outperformed existing filters in occupational health, all combined with the Yale-prognostic filter. The Work Disability Prognosis filter for Research showed a comprehensiveness of 90% (95% CI 86 to 94) and efficiency expressed more user-friendly as Number Needed to Read=20 (95% CI 17 to 34).

One critical step in applying this methodology is to design and execute appropriate and effective search strategy. This is a time-consuming and error-prone step, which needs to be carefully planned and implemented. There is an apparent need for a systematic approach to designing, executing, and evaluating a suitable search strategy for optimally retrieving the target literature from digital libraries. Objective: The main objective of the research reported in this paper is to improve the search step of undertaking SLRs in software engineering (SE) by devising and evaluating systematic and practical approaches to identifying relevant studies in SE. Method: We have systematically selected and analytically studied a large number of papers (SLRs) to understand the state-of-the-practice of search strategies in EBSE. Having identified the limitations of the current ad-hoc nature of search strategies used by SE researchers for SLRs, we have devised a systematic and evidence-based approach to developing and executing optimal search strategies in SLRs. The proposed approach incorporates the concept of 'quasi-gold standard' (QGS), which consists of collection of known studies, and corresponding 'quasi-sensitivity' into the search process for evaluating search performance. Results: We conducted two participant-observer case studies to demonstrate and evaluate the adoption of the proposed QGS-based systematic search approach in support of SLRs in SE research. Conclusion: We report their findings based on the case studies that the approach is able to improve the rigor of search process in an SLR, as well as it can serve as a supplement to the guidelines for SLRs in EBSE.

Automation has been advanced as a potential solution; but given that its efficacy was first demonstrated in 2006, why is it not yet widely used? The Diffusion of Innovations framework by EM Rogers is used to structure an exploration of why this might be the case. Discussion According to Rogers, five characteristics affect the rate of adoption of innovations: those perceived as having greater relative advantage, compatibility, trialability and observability, and less complexity, will be adopted more rapidly than others. The relative advantage of automation has been demonstrated empirically, though usually in narrowly focused reviews in clinical areas, rather than more challenging areas for automation, such as public health. Detailed methods and procedures for their use have yet to be established, addressing transparency, replicability and reporting practices. While issues concerning the compatibility of new technology with existing infrastructure are probably surmountable, the use of automation may challenge contemporary notions of what constitutes a systematic search and how publication bias is addressed using sensitive search techniques. The remaining factors are interrelated. The technologies are complex, both to understand and to deploy. This affects the trialability of automation: technical expertise is required and there are thus few opportunities for reviewers to observe others using these technologies. Conclusion Further technical and empirical work is needed where systematic reviewers work with information and computer scientists to develop solutions which have a demonstrative relative advantage and which are clearly compatible with the needs of systematic reviewers and their users. Such work may have a significant role to play in addressing the deluge of new research publications which threaten to overwhelm systematic review processes.",,2013.0,31.0,"['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","[{'authorId': '2109015958', 'name': 'Jmf Thomas'}]"

The main novelties are the introduction of a set of specific dependency patterns and the introduction of a partially revised TRIZ (Russian acronym for Theory ¨ of Inventive Problem Solving) ¨ ontology to classify the retrieved information. The proposed dependency patterns were manually extracted from a sample patents pool about waste recycling and reuse. The classification of the information is based on different classes: (1) what transformations can be carried out on the waste, (2) what technologies can be used to carry out these transformations, (3) what products can be obtained by transforming the waste, (4) what functions can be carried out by the waste, (5) with which technologies, and (6) on which entities. An automatic implementation of the proposed method, involving the manual check of the retrieved results, was tested through a case study about wood chip recycling and reuse. Compared to the dependency patterns from the literature, the proposed ones allowed to retrieve 28 % more pertinent information. This results mainly depends by better ability of the proposed patterns to better discriminate the relevant sentences from which to extract information, compared to the other patterns (i.e. + 40 %). The automatic classification of the information was also correctly performed: in almost each class, precision and recall were higher than 60 % and on average equal to 90 %.",Comput.

271,52cb07ebebfac6ad6b2dbcf2309a17d03772fa22,The effect of exposure to long working hours on ischaemic heart disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis from the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates of the Work-related Burden of Disease and Injury,"Background - The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) are developing Joint Estimates of the work-related burden of disease and injury (WHO/ILO Joint Estimates), with contributions from a large network of experts. Evidence from mechanistic data suggests that exposure to long working hours may cause ischaemic heart disease (IHD). In this paper, we present a systematic review and meta-analysis of parameters for estimating the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from IHD that are attributable to exposure to long working hours, for the development of the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates. Objectives - We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of exposure to long working hours (three categories: 41-48, 49-54 and ≥55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on IHD (three outcomes: prevalence, incidence and mortality). Data sources - We developed and published a protocol, applying the Navigation Guide as an organizing systematic review framework where feasible. We searched electronic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, CISDOC, PsycINFO, and WHO ICTRP. We also searched grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand-searched reference lists of previous systematic reviews; and consulted additional experts. Study eligibility and criteria - We included working-age (≥15 years) workers in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State but excluded children (aged < 15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. We included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies which contained an estimate of the effect of exposure to long working hours (41-48, 49-54 and ≥55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on IHD (prevalence, incidence or mortality). Study appraisal and synthesis methods - At least two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. Missing data were requested from principal study authors. We combined relative risks using random-effect meta-analysis. Two or more review authors assessed the risk of bias, quality of evidence and strength of evidence, using Navigation Guide and GRADE tools and approaches adapted to this project. Results - Thirty-seven studies (26 prospective cohort studies and 11 case-control studies) met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 768,751 participants (310,954 females) in 13 countries in three WHO regions (Americas, Europe and Western Pacific). The exposure was measured using self-reports in all studies, and the outcome was assessed with administrative health records (30 studies) or self-reported physician diagnosis (7 studies). The outcome was defined as incident non-fatal IHD event in 19 studies (8 cohort studies, 11 case-control studies), incident fatal IHD event in two studies (both cohort studies), and incident non-fatal or fatal (mixed) event in 16 studies (all cohort studies). Because we judged cohort studies to have a relatively lower risk of bias, we prioritized evidence from these studies and treated evidence from case-control studies as supporting evidence. For the bodies of evidence for both outcomes with any eligible studies (i.e. IHD incidence and mortality), we did not have serious concerns for risk of bias (at least for the cohort studies). No eligible study was found on the effect of long working hours on IHD prevalence. Compared with working 35-40 h/week, we are uncertain about the effect on acquiring (or incidence of) IHD of working 41-48 h/week (relative risk (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.07, 20 studies, 312,209 participants, I 0%, quality of evidence) and 49-54 h/week (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.17, 18 studies, 308,405 participants, I 0%, quality of evidence). Compared with working 35-40 h/week, working ≥55 h/week may have led to a moderately, clinically meaningful increase in the risk of acquiring IHD, when followed up between one year and 20 years (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.26, 22 studies, 339,680 participants, I 5%, moderate quality of evidence). Compared with working 35-40 h/week, we are very uncertain about the effect on dying (mortality) from IHD of working 41-48 h/week (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12, 13 studies, 288,278 participants, I 8%, quality of evidence) and 49-54 h/week (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.25, 11 studies, 284,474 participants, I 13%, quality of evidence). Compared with working 35-40 h/week, working ≥55 h/week may have led to a moderate, clinically meaningful increase in the risk of dying from IHD when followed up between eight and 30 years (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.31, 16 studies, 726,803 participants, I 0%, moderate quality of evidence). Subgroup analyses found no evidence for differences by WHO region and sex, but RRs were higher among persons with lower SES. Sensitivity analyses found no differences by outcome definition (exclusively non-fatal or fatal versus mixed), outcome measurement (health records versus self-reports) and risk of bias (high/probably high ratings in any domain versus low/probably low in all domains). Conclusions - We judged the existing bodies of evidence for human evidence as inadequate evidence for harmfulness for the exposure categories 41-48 and 49-54 h/week for IHD prevalence, incidence and mortality, and for the exposure category ≥55 h/week for IHD prevalence. Evidence on exposure to working ≥55 h/week was judged as sufficient evidence of harmfulness for IHD incidence and mortality. Producing estimates for the burden of IHD attributable to exposure to working ≥55 h/week appears evidence-based, and the pooled effect estimates presented in this systematic review could be used as input data for the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates.",Environment international,2020.0,29.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '3774564', 'name': 'Jian Li'}, {'authorId': '6954987', 'name': 'F.

276,2d829c524dd90d674b64a3b4efc3eb3292009702,An automated approach to identifying search terms for systematic reviews using keyword co‐occurrence networks,"Systematic review, meta‐analysis and other forms of evidence synthesis are critical to strengthen the evidence base concerning conservation issues and to answer ecological and evolutionary questions. Synthesis lags behind the pace of scientific publishing, however, due to time and resource costs which partial automation of evidence synthesis tasks could reduce. Additionally, current methods of retrieving evidence for synthesis are susceptible to bias towards studies with which researchers are familiar. In fields that lack standardized terminology encoded in an ontology, including ecology and evolution, research teams can unintentionally exclude articles from the review by omitting synonymous phrases in their search terms. To combat these problems, we developed a quick, objective, reproducible method for generating search strategies that uses text mining and keyword co‐occurrence networks to identify the most important terms for a review. The method reduces bias in search strategy development because it does not rely on a predetermined set of articles and can improve search recall by identifying synonymous terms that research teams might otherwise omit. When tested against the search strategies used in published environmental systematic reviews, our method performs as well as the published searches and retrieves gold‐standard hits that replicated versions of the original searches do not. Because the method is quasi‐automated, the amount of time required to develop a search strategy, conduct searches, and assemble results is reduced from approximately 17–34 hr to under 2 hr. To facilitate use of the method for environmental evidence synthesis, we implemented the method in the R package litsearchr, which also contains a suite of functions to improve efficiency of systematic reviews by automatically deduplicating and assembling results from separate databases.",Methods in Ecology and Evolution,2019.0,43.0,['Computer Science'],"[{'authorId': '1392982175', 'name': 'Eliza M.

The novel framework combines features from both systematic and scoping reviews. It aims at high coverage and reproducibility while mapping technologies—even with a fuzzy initial scope. To achieve these goals for search and triage, a set of closely interrelated methods has been developed: (a) automated query optimization, (b) screening prioritization, and (c) recall estimation. To determine appropriate parameters, a variety of published literature corpora were used and compared with an evaluation on a real‐world dataset. Our results show that it is feasible to automate the identification of relevant works using this newly introduced framework. It achieved a workload reduction of up to 91% “Work‐saved‐over Sampling (WSS)” with a 76% overall recall compared with manually screening search results. Reducing the workload is a prerequisite for a rapid Potential Technologies Review when conducting demand‐pull innovations. Moreover, it facilitates the updating and closer monitoring of latest findings. Studying the robustness of the framework and expanding it to patent documents are future tasks.",Research synthesis methods,2019.0,0.0,"['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '2055653008', 'name': 'Tom Schmitz'}, {'authorId': '49306592', 'name': 'M.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to systematically develop a delay risk terminology and taxonomy. This research also explores two external and internal dimensions of the taxonomy to determine how much the taxonomy as a whole or combinations of its elements are generalisable.


Design/methodology/approach
Using mixed methods research, this systematic literature review incorporated data from 46 articles to establish delay risk terminology and taxonomy. Qualitative data of the top 10 delay risks identified in each article were coded based on the grounded theory and constant comparative analysis using a three-stage coding approach. Word frequency analysis and cross-tabulation were used to develop the terminology and taxonomy. Association rules within the taxonomy were also explored to define risk paths and to unmask associations among the risks.


Findings
In total, 26 delay risks were identified and grouped into ten categories to form the risk breakdown structure. The universal delay risks and other delay risks that are more or less depending on the project location were determined. Also, it is realized that delays connected to equipment, sub-contractors and design drawings are highly connected to project planning, finance and owner slow decision making, respectively.


Originality/value
The established terminology and taxonomy may be used in manual or automated risk management systems as a baseline for delay risk identification, management and communication. In addition, the association rules assist the risk management process by enabling mitigation of a combination of risks together.

Such research literature is identified from a carefully designed search strategy. This thesis explores the search strategy design process for diverse literature, and draws on the findings of five of my research publications. It develops theory from case studies. In doing so, it uses an integrated approach using framework analysis, a thematic analysis and summary to develop higher order themes. These are configured into a model. My candidate publications centre upon a common theme of designing of search strategies for use in social policy-relevant systematic reviews in public health and social care. The findings of these publications are combined with findings from analysing search strategies I have designed for ten systematic reviews and an examination of guidance and methods literature. Ten dimensions of search strategy design emerged from the analysis, which comprise four overarching categories: 1) domain and publishing norms; 2) research questions and scope; 3) terminology; and 4) information organisation. Seven dimensions within these categories can be used to characterise diverse literature: multiple subject domains, diffuse dissemination, multiple search resource types, multiple meanings of search concepts, wide search term diversity, broad indexing terms, and the low discriminating power of the search. The remaining three dimensions are integral dimensions to search strategy design though they do not necessarily characterise diverse literature: search sample, establishing search concepts and searching strategy. Seven categories describing the influences of search strategy design are configured from my analysis: people, processes, resources, evidence, technology, standards and creativity and the problem-solving processes within information searching. A model of search strategy design illustrates how the dimensions and categories relate to each other.",,2018.0,0.0,['Computer Science'],"[{'authorId': '6059379', 'name': 'C. Stansfield'}]"

It argues for clearer distinctions between syntheses produced as public goods and those tailored to specific circumstances, and strengthening knowledge systems through greater use of maps to navigate existing and missing evidence, harmonised outcomes and measures, and advances in automation technologies. Improved methods and guidance are required for synthesising formative research and investigating contextual factors.

It involves a systematic search for studies and aims for a transparent report of study identification, leaving readers clear about what was done to identify studies, and how the findings of the review are situated in the relevant evidence. Information specialists and review teams appear to work from a shared and tacit model of the literature search process. How this tacit model has developed and evolved is unclear, and it has not been explicitly examined before. The purpose of this review is to determine if a shared model of the literature searching process can be detected across systematic review guidance documents and, if so, how this process is reported in the guidance and supported by published studies. A literature review. Two types of literature were reviewed: guidance and published studies. Nine guidance documents were identified, including: The Cochrane and Campbell Handbooks. Published studies were identified through ‘pearl growing’, citation chasing, a search of PubMed using the systematic review methods filter, and the authors’ topic knowledge. The relevant sections within each guidance document were then read and re-read, with the aim of determining key methodological stages. Methodological stages were identified and defined. This data was reviewed to identify agreements and areas of unique guidance between guidance documents. Consensus across multiple guidance documents was used to inform selection of ‘key stages’ in the process of literature searching. Eight key stages were determined relating specifically to literature searching in systematic reviews. They were: who should literature search, aims and purpose of literature searching, preparation, the search strategy, searching databases, supplementary searching, managing references and reporting the search process. Eight key stages to the process of literature searching in systematic reviews were identified. These key stages are consistently reported in the nine guidance documents, suggesting consensus on the key stages of literature searching, and therefore the process of literature searching as a whole, in systematic reviews. Further research to determine the suitability of using the same process of literature searching for all types of systematic review is indicated.",BMC Medical Research Methodology,2018.0,138.0,"['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '144227413', 'name': 'Chris Cooper'}, {'authorId': '144751278', 'name': 'A.
